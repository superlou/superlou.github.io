        <blockquote>
<p>Or, how I started another project I was unlikely to finish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems like everybody else has a UAV, and I donâ€™t. So, letâ€™s try to build one. Iâ€™m a poor writer, but if I force myself to document things in this blog, thereâ€™s a small chance Iâ€™ll keep myself from forgetting why I made decisions and going in circles.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Iâ€™m going to break down the UAV into a few subsystems to make things manageable.</p>
<ol>
<li>Airframe â€“ holds things</li>
<li>Flight Controller â€“ keeps things flying straight and level and provide active stabilization on top of operator signals</li>
<li>Mission Controller â€“ make the UAV do interesting things on its own</li>
</ol>
<p>Thereâ€™s probably some other parts, but I donâ€™t know enough about UAVs or R/C aircraft to speak to the subject. Iâ€™m not quite sure why Iâ€™m splitting up the Flight and Mission Controller yet, but it seems like a decent way of keeping the design requirements focused. Iâ€™ve been looking at some existing autopilot boards, and havenâ€™t seem to find one I liked that had all the features I wanted. Iâ€™m looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 receiver channels, with 1 channel being decoded in hardware to enable the autopilot or bypass the microprocessor</li>
<li>Accelerometer, gyroscope, altitude, and compass</li>
<li>DSP capable processor with a Linux compatible tool-chain
The architecture is something like this:</li>
</ul>

<p>After some searching, I did the thing I usually do when I feel like Google isnâ€™t providing a good idea of where the community is: hit up IRC. Nebukadneza from ##radiocontrol on Freenode was incredibly patient with me and pointed me towards the Naze32. Itâ€™s a great piece of hardware at an awesome price, but doesnâ€™t have software independent bypasses. Weâ€™re doing a bunch of development stuff and need to give control to the ground operator if/when the software locks up. Iâ€™m going to thus use this minor nitpick to design my own flight controller. As I go, Iâ€™ll try to write articles about what Iâ€™ve learned and how Iâ€™ve applied it to the autopilot.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m open to any comments, criticisms, feature requests, etc.</p>
