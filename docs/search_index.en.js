produces a weekly news/entertainment program called The Local Live.  The format features a live interview segment where community calls, emails, and tweets are taken on the air.  To keep the contact information onscreen throughout the entire segment, I wanted to animate the contact info into a graphics bug.  The station uses a Newtek Toaster Tricaster 860.  By dedicating a video playback DDR to a DSK channel, we can overlay videos with alpha.\nCreate the Animation in Blender\nThis is the time consuming part.  Since all I needed was some rotating graphics, this was more tedious than difficult.  Likely, there are more efficient tools than Blender for this (giving the text meshes an outline was painful), but sometimes you only have a hammer.\n\nIf you’re also making a bug, here’s some things to keep in mind:\n\nMake sure that your video loops seamlessly.  This will let you set the DDR on loop so you can run the bug.\nThink about the graphic elements that make up the bug.  It’s very easy to lose track of scale when you are zoomed in and fine-tuning animations.  Make sure your text will be readable after the graphic is scaled and positioned on-screen.\nConsider removing all lamps from the scene and use environment lighting.  This can give you a very soft light that makes your graphic look less like an intro-to-3D-modeling project.\nIn the Scene Properties, don’t set your resolution overly high.  In my settings, I used 1280×720 pixels, but left the render scale percentage at 50%.  Make sure that the bug fills the camera’s viewport well, but does not clip.  An alternative is to make your render at your full broadcast resolution and position the camera so that the bug is the expected size and position in the frame, but this can make it awkward to work with down the road, since the video will be mostly empty space.  Double check your framerate settings so that everything plays back at the expected speed when we’re done.\n\nTricaster supports transparency in the DDR through Quicktime videos with alpha.  Since Blender doesn’t render (at least on my system) directly to this format, we’ll output a series of PNGs and combine them later into the video.  By rendering to “//render/”, I’ll get a folder with a set of PNG files titled 0001.png, 0002.png, 0003.png, etc.  Make sure that “RGBA” is selected so that we have the alpha channel for transparency.\n\nThe final Blender file is available for reference here.\nMerging the Image Sequence\nWe’ll create the video from our rendered image sequence using Libav‘s avconv utility.  It’s an easy one-liner:\navconv -r 29.97 -i render/%4d.png -vcodec png bug.mov\n\nThis explicitly tells avconv the framerate to use, the location and filename format of the images (%4d refers to a 4-digit integer), the video codec, and the output wrapper.  Once done, you should have .mov file that you can play in your player of choice.   The area where the video is fully transparent is typically black, though it may vary from player to player.  Note that these files will be pretty large because of the codec we’re using.  My 2 minute bug came to around 100 MB.\nSetting Up Tricaster\nImport the video as you would any other media, except make sure you do not enable transcoding, which may remove the transparency.  With some luck, you have a free DDR.  I added the bug video to DDR2, and set the DDR to autoplay+single+loop.  Set DSK2 to use that DDR.  You can position and scale the bug using the standard DSK transform controls.  Now, when you fade-in DSK2, it will fade-in the graphic and start the animation.  Since we made sure our video loops seamlessly, you can leave it up until you are bored with it.  You can see the finished project in action in the lower-right corner of the show.\n\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/animated-bugs-with-blender-and-tricaster/","title":"Animated Bugs with Blender and Tricaster"},"https://superlou.github.io/budget-indoor-quadcopter/":{"body":"Remote control quadcopters have been around for years, as has been \"First-Person View\" flying. If you're new to the hobby, plowing an expensive FPV racing drone into a house might not seem too appealing. There are also some considerations imposed by the FAA. However, there are indoor miniature quadcopters now, and here's how to put one together on-the-cheap. You can go from zero to FPV for about $70, including the drone, remote control, and goggles.\nMaterials\nYou'll need the following parts, all of which are available online. While a soldering station is required, all of the contacts soldered are large.\n\nRC quadcopter\n5.8 GHz camera\n5.8 GHz goggles\n\nRC Quadcopter\nThere are many options, but you want something with a 65 mm span between diagonal motors. These are the smallest, readily available size and are often referred to as \"tiny whoops.\" I bought an Eachine E011C (Banggood) which includes:\n\nFrame\nFlight controller with integrated receiver - This small PCB provides all of the control and drive circuitry. This flight controller (FC) integrates a Bayang protocol receiver, which means it has the circuitry and antenna required to receive signals from a bayang remote control.\n4 brushed DC motors - The E011 and E011C are particularly nice because they include 7x16 mm motors, which provide more power than the 6x15 mm motors on an E010 or E013 drone. While these brushed motors wear out over time, replacements are inexpensive.\n4 propellers\nBattery - a 260 mAh LiPo battery\nRemote control - The included remote uses the Bayang protocol to match the receiver on the flight controller.\nA lego Santa Claus\n\n5.8 GHz Camera\nLow-cost FPV drones usually broadcast analog video in order to minimize latency and cost. We want a camera with a built-in 5.8 GHz transmitter. While there are both NTSC and PAL cameras, the important thing is that the goggles match. That said, most newer cameras can switch between NTSC and PAL modes as well as many frequencies.\nHere are some options:\n\n5.8 GHz FPV camera installed in a canopy (Amazon) - This is probably the easiest one to get started with since it is already installed in a canopy.\n5.8 GHz FPV camera with OSD signals (Aliexpress) - This camera is a little cheaper and provides video input and output signals. Down the road, you could use these with a flight controller that supports an On-Screen Display (OSD). The camera's video output is overlayed with information like flight duration then sent back to the camera for broadcast via the video input signal. Since the E011C doesn't support OSD, it's not necessary. However, you will also need to buy a canopy or hack something together to hold it in place.\n\n5.8 GHz Goggles\nAny pair of goggles that matches the frequency and video standard of the camera will work. The Eachine VR006 (Banggood) is the lowest priced goggles I could find with reasonable reviews. If you need goggles faster, the Makerfire Mini FPV goggles (Amazon) are more expensive.\nWhile the goggles are the most expensive single component of this build, they can be used in future builds.\nOptional Parts\nWhile everything above is the bare minimum to start flying, these parts have enough added value that they're worth considering:\n\nJST PH 2.0 connector cable (Amazon) - This is the same cable that mates with the provided battery. While the provided battery has a wired connector that plugs into the flight controller, many batteries have the connector hard mounted to the battery. By replacing the board-mount connector on the flight controller PCB with this cable, you can connect to either battery.\n260 mAh HV 1S LiPo battery x8 (Amazon) - If you want to fly for more than 2 minutes at a time, you'll need more batteries. These \"high-voltage\" batteries can charge to 4.35 V to hold more energy.\n1S LiPo HV charger (Amazon) - This charger can charge either 4.2 V or 4.35 V 1S LiPo batteries.\nLiPo charging safety bag (Amazon) or (AliExpress)- Battery safes trap a fire in the case of battery failure during charging.\n\nBuilding\nThe E011C is festive.\n\nHowever, the medley of Christmas music gets old, and the speaker is added weight. The speaker is on the bottom of the quadcopter, attached to the PCB. You can see it under the battery holder.\n\nDesolder the black and red wires connecting the speaker to the PCB pads.\n\nOptionally, remove the battery header that is soldered to the PCB and replace it with a wired connector.\n\nBe very careful to make sure that the red and black wires connect to the positive and negative pads respectively.\n\nCut the connector of the camera, leaving as much wire as possible. Strip back the wires and solder the red and black wires to the positive and negative battery terminals.\n\nSince this camera comes preinstalled in a canopy with an insulating bumper on the bottom of the camera, assemble by gently pulling apart the camera's bottom tabs and slipping them over the posts on the frame.\n\nCharge the quadcopter's and goggle's batteries. Power everything up and use the frequency scan on the goggles to find the camera's video signal.\n\nHappy flying!\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/budget-indoor-quadcopter/","title":"Budget Indoor Quadcopters"},"https://superlou.github.io/building-a-uav/":{"body":"\nOr, how I started another project I was unlikely to finish.\n\nIt seems like everybody else has a UAV, and I don’t. So, let’s try to build one. I’m a poor writer, but if I force myself to document things in this blog, there’s a small chance I’ll keep myself from forgetting why I made decisions and going in circles.\n\nI’m going to break down the UAV into a few subsystems to make things manageable.\n\nAirframe – holds things\nFlight Controller – keeps things flying straight and level and provide active stabilization on top of operator signals\nMission Controller – make the UAV do interesting things on its own\n\nThere’s probably some other parts, but I don’t know enough about UAVs or R/C aircraft to speak to the subject. I’m not quite sure why I’m splitting up the Flight and Mission Controller yet, but it seems like a decent way of keeping the design requirements focused. I’ve been looking at some existing autopilot boards, and haven’t seem to find one I liked that had all the features I wanted. I’m looking for:\n\n8 receiver channels, with 1 channel being decoded in hardware to enable the autopilot or bypass the microprocessor\nAccelerometer, gyroscope, altitude, and compass\nDSP capable processor with a Linux compatible tool-chain\nThe architecture is something like this:\n\n\nAfter some searching, I did the thing I usually do when I feel like Google isn’t providing a good idea of where the community is: hit up IRC. Nebukadneza from ##radiocontrol on Freenode was incredibly patient with me and pointed me towards the Naze32. It’s a great piece of hardware at an awesome price, but doesn’t have software independent bypasses. We’re doing a bunch of development stuff and need to give control to the ground operator if/when the software locks up. I’m going to thus use this minor nitpick to design my own flight controller.

When designing an autonomous system, it's critical to have clear objectives so that the requirements for end effectors, sensory inputs, and processing resources can be achieved inside your cost and time budgets.  Instead of that, let's try to settle an office debate: what are the kinematics of a robotic platform positioned by 3 control rods?\nThen, we'll put eyes on it.  And it needs to fit on my desk; my apartment is not very large.\nPlatform Kinematics\nThe control of the platform, i.e. head, needs to use a minimum number of servos.  Since linear actuators are bulky and expensive, we'll use 3 servo motors to control the orientation of the platform.  The servo motor arms will face \"inwards\" towards the platform, and a hinged leg on each motor will terminate in a ball-joint at the platform.  Letting the center of rotation of the servos create our base reference frame, the system looks like this:\n\nIt's a parallel robot a little like a stripped down Stewart Platform, popular for it's six degrees of freedom.  Each orange joint has 1 degree-of-freedom (DOF) and rotates like a hinge.  Each yellow joint has 3 DOFs, fixing the connection in space but ideally allowing unconstrained rotation.\nOur back of the napkin guess is that the 3 servos should give us 3 DOFs if our design is well constrained.  A more formal analysis using the mobility formula agrees.  Our simplified platform system is composed of 7 linked rigid bodies: 3 lower legs, 3 upper legs, and the platform itself.  These are all referenced to a fixed global reference plane that the lower legs are attached to.  These $n$ movable bodies each have 6 degrees of freedom before and linkages are made.  Then, each linkage removes up to 6 degrees of freedom, e.g. a hinge or linear slider removes 5, a planar slider removes 4, a spherical ball joint removes 3.  This gives us the mobility formula for our 6 hinge joints and 3 ball joints:\n$$M = 6n - \\sum_{i=1}^{j}6-f_i$$\n$$M = 6 * 7 - \\left(6 * 5 + 3 * 3\\right) = 3$$\nSince the platform is the basis for our robot's head, we'll add one more servo in the center of the platform.  This neck allows the robot to look left and right.  This adds a fourth degree of freedom which can be verified using the same formula.\n\nConcept Investigation\nNow that we have explored the kinematics, we can waste time with some concept renders showing the interaction of the 4 servos.  Modeling the system to scale in Blender and using inverse kinematic constraints  to \"pull\" the head and platform demonstrates that the basic concept works out.\n\nFor this project, all resources will be in a Github repository.\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/deskbot-part-1-architecture/","title":"Deskbot Part 1, Architecture"},"https://superlou.github.io/deskbot-part-2-hardware-prototype/":{"body":"Let's make a desktop robot that moves.  But wait, we have no tools.\nMechanics\nWe're going to have to deal with as many off the shelf parts as possible.  If you remember from our previous episode, it's going to look something like this:\n\nSince this is a prototype, we'll focus on the core parts of the mechanism.\n\nThe lower actuators are 3 Hitec HS-311 servos.  Attached directly to the servo is a \"servo horn,\" luckily one of the ones supplied.  Now we need to get creative.  For the vertical upper leg, I used Du-Bro 4-40 Safety Lock Kwik-Links with a Heavy Duty 4-40 Ball Link.\n\nDu-Bro seems to have some quality control issues on these parts.  One of the ball links and one of the Kwik-Links weren't threaded, but luckily the office has a tap and die set.  At the servo horn/Kwik-Link joint, we want a 1 degree-of-freedom hinge, so carefully expand the servo horn to accommodate the Kwik-Link pin with a small screwdriver bit.  The soft plastic of these parts (and the concentration of force at the hinge joint) will limit the accuracy of the system's control, but for a light platform, it seems good enough.  A future prototype should focus on making sure the knee hinge is more robust to off-axis forces.\nThe fourth servo is a Tower Pro SG92R micro servo from Adafruit.  It's smaller than the rest since not much torque is required, and we want to minimize the weight and size of parts going in the platform.\nThe platform itself is made up of two custom parts designed in FreeCad.  They were designed to be as cheap to 3D print as possible, so complexity and volume are kept to a minimum.  The flat servo head mount and socket pin are a couple dollars from Shapeways, though I'm not sure the dimensions will work out, as I had them printed by a local shop on a Makerbot.\n\nThe printed parts needed a lot of clean-up, especially the socket pins, due to the precision of the FDM process.  To get the ball links to spin freely in the sockets, I borrowed the office drill press and used a ball link to ream out the socket pins.\n\nThe finished platform assembly with base servos was cut into some cardboard.\n\nElectronics\nThe brain of the robot will be a Raspberry Pi, the old original version I had lying around.  A newer Raspberry Pi 2 Model B should work just as well, and give a lot more flexibility on the software, but you'll need a 40-pin GPIO Cobbler Plus instead of the older style breakout.\nIn lieu of a proper schematic, the connections are:\n\nAll servo power lines to the servo power supply, a 4 V wall wart I had lying around, though it should really be around 6 V.\nConnect the servo grounds to the power supply ground.\nConnect the servo power supply ground to the RPi ground.\nConnect the four servo signal lines to pins 18, 23, 24, and 25.\n\n\nSoftware\nRaspian is used as the RPi's OS.  To keep the software readable, I oscillated between high level languages, Ruby and Python.  I like the Ruby syntax better, but  the numerical computing libraries for Python are much more mature, and I later found Cython to be a critical tool for improving performance.\nPi-blaster is used to create PWM signals on the RPi's GPIO pins.  The code for controlling the servos is wrapped in a pair of helper classes: PiBlasterServos, and Servo.  These classes abstract the process of interpolating a servo angular position to a PWM period and writing it to /dev/pi-blaster.  Controlling a servo is done like so:\n# parameters are the 0 degs PWM period, -90 degs, and +90 degs\ns0 = Servo(0.15, 0.065, 0.225)  \npbs = PiBlasterServos()\npbs.add(s0, 18)  # use pin 18\npbs[0] = 0.0     # set the first servo added to 0 degrees\n\nBy varying the position of the 4 servos in time, we can start animating the robot.\n\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/deskbot-part-2-hardware-prototype/","title":"Deskbot Part 2, Hardware Prototype"},"https://superlou.github.io/deskbot-part-3-forward-kinematics/":{"body":"The process of determining the state of the robot from the control inputs is the forward kinematics.  For a given set of 4 servo positions, we should be able to predict the orientation of all parts of the robot.\n\nHere's our model of the robot head platform.  There's one more servo on top, but because that's a serial linkage, as opposed to the three parallel mechanisms at the base, we can account for that later.  The platform itself is an equilateral triangle.  While this arrangement could be generalized further, the following assumes that the base points also form an equilateral triangle, aligned with the platform.\n\nFrom the diagram, we see that for each hinged linkage from a servo to the platform, the three points - base $B_i$, knee $K_i$, and platform $P_i$ - move in a single plane.  The base points are at:\n$$B_i=\\begin{bmatrix}b_{xi}\\b_{yi}\\0\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}r_b cos(\\theta_i)\\r_b sin(\\theta_i)\\0\\end{bmatrix}$$\nKnowing the three servo angles $\\theta_i$, the knee points are analytically solvable with basic geometry.\n$$\nK_i= B_i +\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nl cos(\\pi+\\theta_b) sin(\\alpha_i) \\\\\nl sin(\\pi+\\theta_b) sin(\\alpha_i) \\\\\nl sin(\\alpha_i)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nLikewise, if we know $\\gamma_i$, the platform points are solvable:\n$$\nP_i= K_i +\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nl cos(\\pi+\\theta_b) sin(\\gamma_i) \\\\\nl sin(\\pi+\\theta_b) sin(\\gamma_i) \\\\\nl sin(\\gamma_i)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow, the problem is, we don't know $\\gamma_i$.  Fortunately, we can construct three equations to solve for these: the distance between any to $P_i$ is fixed by the geometry of the platform.  To use fsolve from SciPy's optimization package to solve simultaneous functions, we need to write a minimization function.\nclass DeskbotModel(object):\n    ...\n\n    def errors(self, p):\n        gamma_0, gamma_1, gamma_2 = p\n        gamma = np.array([gamma_0, gamma_1, gamma_2])\n\n        # Determine positions of platform points\n        self.p = np.array([\n            self.k[0] + self.m * np.cos(np.pi + self.theta_b) * np.cos(gamma),\n            self.k[1] + self.m * np.sin(np.pi + self.theta_b) * np.cos(gamma),\n            self.k[2] + self.m * np.sin(gamma),\n        ])\n\n        d01 = np.linalg.norm(self.p[:, 0] - self.p[:, 1])\n        d12 = np.linalg.norm(self.p[:, 1] - self.p[:, 2])\n        d20 = np.linalg.norm(self.p[:, 2] - self.p[:, 0])\n\n        return (d01 - self.d[0], d12 - self.d[1], d20 - self.d[2])\n\nThe array of three gamma values is then found by optimize.fsolve(self.errors, (1.57, 1.57, 1.57)).  Our initial guesses are $\\pi/2$, a 90 degree bend at each knee, in the hope of the solver picking the platform position above our global reference frame, as there is another solution (probably multiple).  After solving, we can then determine the location of all 3 platform points.  Everything after that is a little bit of vector math, but is simple serial links to solve for the geometry.\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/deskbot-part-3-forward-kinematics/","title":"Deskbot Part 3, Forward Kinematics"},"https://superlou.github.io/deskbot-part-4-inverse-kinematics/":{"body":"Unfortunately for us, forward kinematics doesn't let our robot control itself.  To determine the servo positions that achieve a robot position, we need inverse kinematics.\n\nIn a perfect world, there is an analytical function that takes a robot state as input variables and spits out servo positions.  Even if you can't come up with a simple analytical solution, if you have a fast solution to the forward kinematis, you can use something like coordinate descent or particle swarm optimization.  These techniques provide efficient numerical solutions with large numbers of dependent variables.\nDoubly unfortunate, we only have a numerical forward kinematics solution, and a fairly slow one for the Raspberry Pi.  If you were to use one of those previous optimization techniques, you end up with solvers of solvers which quickly bottleneck a real-time robot.  Neural networks could be an interesting solution, but the Rapspberry Pi isn't well suited to parallelizing mathematics, and my early attempts ran into issues because of the periodicity of servo solutions.  Rather than learning how to contrain the learning functions, let's try another approach.\nConstraints\nThe platform of the Deskbot, the head, is modeled as an equilateral triangle, with each point connected on hinged joints to a servo.  Because of the geometry of the hinges, each point is constrained to moving in a plane.\n\nThe red hinges and platform points are constrained to the red plane, the blue and green planes, likewise.\nPlatform Inverse Kinematics\nNow we need a way to mathematically describe the desired state of the robot.\n\nWe are limiting our IK model to just the head for now.  The three points, $P_{1,2,3}$, are the corners of the equilateral triangle that make up the platform.  $P_C$ is the centroid of the platform.  Point $N$ is straight up from the centroid.  Perpendicular to $N$ and in the plane of the platform, vector $\\vec{e}$ represents the direction the eyes of the robot are looking.  $\\vec{f}$ is the left-ear, and must always be 90 degrees from $\\vec{e}$.  We use the left ear so that our system follows right-hand rule: when we use unit vectors for the eye and ear, their cross product will point upwards and produce a unit vector perpendicular to both.  This new perpendicular unit vector is scaled by the length of the \"neck\" to produce $N$.  The really great thing about these two vectors is that they give references we can rotate around that are natural: tilting the head up and down regardless of the direction it is looking is a rotation about the ear vector, and canting the head is a rotation about the eye vector.\nOur solution will work backwards.  We want to achieve a $\\vec{e}$ and $\\vec{f}$ and care only about the z position of $N$.  Moving $\\vec{e}$ and $\\vec{f}$ around rotates our platform in space, however the platform's points must still lie in their limited planes of motions.  Shifting the platform points back to achievable positions is mostly translation, but also causes a rotation.  $\\theta$ provides a necessary degree of freedom so that the eye and ear vectors can be achieve while still keeping the platform on it's planar \"rails.\"  We assume there is a $P_c$ and $\\theta$ that aligns the platform in an achievable position while satisfying the eye and ear vectors.\nGiving up on doing this analytically, let's go back to using a solver.  Our error function seek to solve 4 equations for zero: the distance of a platform point to a plane (three of these), and the difference between the z-coordinate of $N$ and our desired height.  In python, that looks like this:\n    def errors(self, x, rot_mat, tan60, e_v, n_v, h, l, n):\n        theta, px, py, pz = x\n\n        # Because n_v is fixed, after finding p0, a precomputed\n        # rotation matrix can be used to find p1 and p2.\n        p0_v = rotate_vector(l * e_v, n_v, -theta)\n        p1_v = np.dot(rot_mat, p0_v)\n        p2_v = np.dot(rot_mat, p1_v)\n\n        pc = np.array([px, py, pz])\n        p0 = p0_v + pc\n        p1 = p1_v + pc\n        p2 = p2_v + pc\n\n        n_p = pc + n * n_v\n\n        return (point_line_distance(p0, 0),\n                point_line_distance(p1, -tan60),\n                point_line_distance(p2, tan60),\n                n_p[2] - h)\n\nEach solver iteration receives list x, which is composed of the $\\theta$ and the coordinates of $P_c$.  The rest of the arguments are constants:\n\nrot_mat - a rotational matrix used to get $\\vec{p_1}$ and $\\vec{p_2}$ from $\\vec{p_0}$.  Since $\\vec{e}$ and $\\vec{f}$ are known and fixed unit vectors, $\\vec{n}$ can be determined by $\\vec{e}\\times\\vec{f}$.  The rotational matrix rotates a vector around $\\vec{n}$ by 120 degrees.\ntan60 - Simply the value of $\\tan(60)$ to save on some computation.  This is used to construct the planes that the platform points are constrained in.\ne_v and f_v - the eye and ear vectors\nh - The desired z-position (height) of the point that the eye and ear vectors originate from\nl - the length of the $\\vec{p_{0,1,2}}$ vectors.  This is the distance from $P_c$ to any $P_{0,1,2}$.\nn - the length of $\\vec{n}$, the neck.  This is the distance from $P_c$ to $N$.\n\nA magic function called rotate_vector rotates a vector about another vector by a radian value:\ndef rotate_vector(vector, axis, angle):\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses Rodrigues rotation formula\n    axis must be a normal vector\n    \"\"\"\n    k = axis\n    v = vector\n    v_rot = (v * np.cos(angle) + np.cross(k, v) * np.sin(angle) +\n             k * (np.dot(k, v)) * (1 - np.cos(angle)))\n\n    return v_rot\n\nThe point-line distance is a simplification of the problem of finding the distance between a point and a plane.  Since our planes our parallel with the z-axis, we can flatten the point and plane into the X-Y plane for the sake of minimizing their distances.   The function looks like this:\ndef point_line_distance(point, line_slope):\n    \"\"\"\n    Based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_from_a_point_to_a_line\n    Assumes line passes through zero\n    Let b = 1\n    \"\"\"\n    x0 = point[0]\n    y0 = point[1]\n    a = -line_slope\n\n    distance = np.abs(a * x0 + y0) / np.sqrt(a ** 2 + 1)\n    return distance\n\nThe error function is minimized using trusty fsolve and an initial estimate for the same list of variables x we saw before:\n        theta_init = np.arctan2(e_v[1], e_v[0])\n        pz_init = self.h - self.n\n\t\testimate = [theta_init, 0, 0, pz_init]\n        x = optimize.fsolve(self.errors, estimate, args=(\n            rot_mat, tan60, e_v, n_v, self.h, self.l, self.n\n        ))\n\nSince our head is going to mostly be \"flat,\" a good estimate is that $\\theta$ is the same as the desired direction of the eye vector, and the z-coordinate of $P_c$ will simply be the difference between the desired height and the neck length.  As the head tilts more, these estimates aren't great, but we'll address that if it becomes an issue.\nNow, the only tricky part is creating valid eye and ear vectors.  The simplest way is to start with a pair of unit vectors in global coordinates.\ngx_v = np.array([1, 0, 0])  # global X-axis unit vector\ngy_v = np.array([0, 1, 0])  # global Y-axis unit vector\ngz_v = np.array([0, 0, 1])  # global Z-axis unit vector\n\ne_v = np.array([1, 0, 0])   # initial eye vector, looking down the x-axis\nf_v = np.array([0, 1, 0])   # initial left-ear vector, listening down the y-axis\n\n# turn the head 20 degrees left\ne_v = rotate_vector(e_v, gz_v, radians(20))\nf_v = rotate_vector(f_v, gz_v, radians(20))\n\n# tilt the head up 30 degrees (no effect on f_v)\ne_v = rotate_vector(e_v, f_v, radians(30))\n\n# cant the head to the right 15 degrees (no effect on e_v)\nf_v = rotate_vector(f_v, e_v, radians(-15))\n\nWhen our solver finishes, we will have $\\theta$ and $P_c$ that positions the platform so that the eye and ear vectors are satisfied.  From these values, we can use geometry to determine $P_{0,1,2}$.  Since these points must lie in the planes that the servos can move the points in, we simply need an algorithm to determine the servo angles to achieve each point.  The constrains of the system will then fix up the platform in our desired position.\nLeg Inverse Kinematics\nCan't skip leg day.  Since we're assuming the parallel linkages of the servo \"legs\" and the platform will constrain the system, we can look at each servo base-knee-platform linkage individual.  We can simplify the 3D problem into a 2D one:\n\nEven discounting the periodic nature of rotational joints, their can be multiple solutions: one with the knee flexing up, one with the knee flexing down.  To solve each linkage, lets take advantage of the 2D simplification.  Before we solve any anything, we'll translate and rotate the linkage so that the base is at $(0,0)$ and the motion is only in the x-z plane.\n\nI apologize for the sloppy naming of axes and variables with the same notation.  The important thing is that we can construct two equations with two unknowns for this geometry:\n$$\nlcos(\\alpha) + mcos(\\beta) = x \\\\\nlsin(\\alpha) + msin(\\beta) = z\n$$\nWe primarily want to solve for $\\alpha$, since that will be the servo angle in the linkage, unaffected by our reduction of the problem's dimensions.  Solving, we end up with:\n$$\n(m^2 - l^2 - x^2 - z^2) + 2xlcos(\\alpha) + 2zlsin(\\alpha) = 0\n$$\nThere are some nice symmatries of terms giving us a good feeling about the equation.  We define some helper variables:\n$$\na = m^2 - l^2 - x^2 - z^2 \\\\\nb = 2xl \\\\\nc = 2zl \\\\\na + b cos(\\alpha) + c sin(\\alpha) = 0\n$$\nHowever, to continue solving, we employ the world's sneakiest substitution:\n$$\nt = tan(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}) \\\\\nsin(\\alpha)=\\frac{2t}{1+t^2} \\\\\ncos(\\alpha)=\\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}\n$$\nMaking the substitution, we eventually end up with:\n$$\n\\frac{(a-b)t^2 + 2ct + (a+b)}{1+t^2} = 0\n$$\nSince $t$ can't ever be imaginary, there's no worries about poles in the denominator.  The solutions in the numerator can be solved by the quadratic equation, which conveniently gives two solutions and smells right given the expected solutions.  We will only take the smaller of the two solutions, since that is the one with the join flexing upwards, keeping the linkages \"inside\" the body of the robot for more states.\nTrying It Out\nFor those still following at home, here's what we're going to do:\n\nChoose an eye vector, ear vector, and height of the head.\nDetermine a platform position that can achieve this given the constraints plaftform points must move in their planes.\nDetermine the servo angle that makes it possible for the platform point to be in the proper spot.\nLet the constraints of the parallel linkages and platform do the rest.\n\nI made a quick program that lets me rotate, tilt, cant, and raise/lower the head using keyboard inputs.\n\nIn the first couple seconds, we increase the height of the head, then tilt the eyes up around the ear vector.  As the head rotates around the global z-azis, the eye vector remains tilted upwards.  Having rotated, we can tilt the eyes down and rotate back.  Then we can't the head along the eye vector for the fun of it.  Each individual motion transforms the desired state of the robot, then solves the IK problems to achieve it.\nWhy does the head tilt a little as we perform the rotation?  It's very likely that the cardboard and hacked parts don't perfectly meet the model dimensions.  We'll have to address that later, but for now, this seems like a decent proof-of-concept.\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/deskbot-part-4-inverse-kinematics/","title":"Deskbot Part 4, Inverse Kinematics"},"https://superlou.github.io/deskbot-part-5-optimization/":{"body":"Now that we have a basic inverse kinematic model, the sky's the limit.

In this case, we're going to use cProfile which is recommended in most cases because it has significantly less overhead compared to the pure Python profile module.\nModify the code slightly to profile behavior:\nimport cProfile as profile\n...\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    ...\n    while True:\n        profile.run(\"t = behavior(pbs, full_ik, f_v, t, freq)\")\n\nNow, everytime the function is called, profiling information will be printed.\n         327 function calls in 0.157 seconds\n\n   Ordered by: standard name\n\n   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.157    0.157 &lt;string&gt;:1(&lt;module&gt;)\n        2    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 fromnumeric.py:1211(shape)\n        1    0.002    0.002    0.126    0.126 full_ik.py:14(solve)\n        4    0.000    0.000    0.008    0.002 function_base.py:979(interp)\n        3    0.002    0.001    0.018    0.006 leg_ik.py:12(solve)\n        3    0.014    0.005    0.014    0.005 leg_ik.py:37(two_link_from_origin_ik)\n        3    0.000    0.000    0.001    0.000 leg_ik.py:5(__init__)\n        2    0.001    0.000    0.001    0.000 linalg.py:1840(norm)\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.015    0.015 minpack.py:12(_check_func)\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.096    0.096 minpack.py:30(fsolve)\n       13    0.006    0.000    0.011    0.001 numeric.py:1128(cross)\n       30    0.001    0.000    0.002    0.000 numeric.py:167(asarray)\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 numeric.py:237(asanyarray)\n        4    0.000    0.000    0.028    0.007 pi_blaster_servos.py:20(__setitem__)\n       11    0.020    0.002    0.081    0.007 platform_ik.py:104(errors)\n        1    0.001    0.001    0.002    0.002 platform_ik.py:21(rotation_matrix)\n       33    0.020    0.001    0.020    0.001 platform_ik.py:41(point_line_distance)\n        1    0.002    0.002    0.103    0.103 platform_ik.py:63(solve)\n       12    0.019    0.002    0.039    0.003 platform_ik.py:8(rotate_vector)\n        4    0.000    0.000    0.008    0.002 servo.py:11(period_for_angle)\n        1    0.001    0.001    0.028    0.028 servo_ik_benchmark.py:19(set_servo_angles)\n        1    0.002    0.002    0.157    0.157 servo_ik_benchmark.py:27(behavior)\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 shape_base.py:6(atleast_1d)\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {any}\n        4    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {isinstance}\n        3    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {len}\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {math.cos}\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {math.sin}\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {math.sqrt}\n        5    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'append' of 'list' objects}\n        6    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'astype' of 'numpy.ndarray' objects}\n        2    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'conj' of 'numpy.ndarray' objects}\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'disable' of '_lsprof.Profiler' objects}\n        4    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'format' of 'str' objects}\n        4    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'item' of 'numpy.ndarray' objects}\n        2    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'ravel' of 'numpy.ndarray' objects}\n        2    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'reduce' of 'numpy.ufunc' objects}\n       26    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'swapaxes' of 'numpy.ndarray' objects}\n        4    0.019    0.005    0.019    0.005 {method 'write' of 'file' objects}\n        3    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {min}\n       43    0.011    0.000    0.011    0.000 {numpy.core._dotblas.dot}\n       69    0.012    0.000    0.012    0.000 {numpy.core.multiarray.array}\n        3    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {numpy.core.multiarray.zeros}\n        4    0.007    0.002    0.007    0.002 {numpy.lib._compiled_base.interp}\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {range}\n        1    0.014    0.014    0.081    0.081 {scipy.optimize._minpack._hybrd}\n        2    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {time.time}\n\nThe function is now taking almost twice as long as it was before, which is due to the overhead of the profiler.  The column we're most interested in is \"tottime,\" which is the total amount of time spent in each function, not including function calls within it.  Functions that are called many times, \"ncalls,\" are and high \"tottime\" are really good candidates for optimization since small improvements in frequently called functions will add up.  point_line_distance and rotate_vector look like good candidates.  Since we have the benchmarking info from our target system, we can move back to a normal desktop PC to avoid having to develop over SSH.  Since my PC's a good deal faster than the RPi, we need a more aggressive test case:\nimport cProfile as profile\nfrom numpy import radians, array\nfrom kinematics.inverse.platform_ik import rotate_vector\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    e_v = array([1, 0, 0])\n    gy_v = array([0, 1, 0])\n    angle = radians(10)\n\n    profile.run(\"for i in range(10000): rotate_vector(e_v, gy_v, angle)\")\n\nThe profile output is:\n         150003 function calls in 0.382 seconds\n\n   Ordered by: standard name\n\n   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)\n        1    0.007    0.007    0.382    0.382 &lt;string&gt;:1(&lt;module&gt;)\n    30000    0.028    0.000    0.028    0.000 numeric.py:1404(rollaxis)\n    10000    0.155    0.000    0.217    0.000 numeric.py:1553(cross)\n    20000    0.011    0.000    0.014    0.000 numeric.py:414(asarray)\n    10000    0.144    0.000    0.375    0.000 platform_ik.py:8(rotate_vector)\n    20000    0.002    0.000    0.002    0.000 {len}\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'disable' of '_lsprof.Profiler' objects}\n    30000    0.010    0.000    0.010    0.000 {numpy.core.multiarray.array}\n    10000    0.014    0.000    0.014    0.000 {numpy.core.multiarray.dot}\n    10000    0.007    0.000    0.007    0.000 {numpy.core.multiarray.empty}\n    10000    0.003    0.000    0.003    0.000 {numpy.core.multiarray.promote_types}\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {range}\n\nThe majority of our time is spent in rotate_vector and cross.  The later is part of numpy, so there's not much to do there.  The former we have some control over, but it's pretty much just Python assignments.\nCython\nFunction rotate_vector's pretty much as optimized as it gets in Python.  It's purely assignments, basic mathematics, and vector operations that are already delegated to a very fast library.  We're going to sidestep Python by using Cython, which is an \"optimising static compiler\" for both Python and a C-like Cython programming language.  This is not to be confused with CPython which is the popular implementation of the Python interpreter written in C, or compiling a C executible and calling it from python.  It is safest to think of Cython as a compiled language that has Python-like and C-like attributes, that is designed to interoperate with Python code while achieving compiled-language performance.\nTo install Cython, we need a full C development environment.  On Linux for Python 2.7, this is straightforward, remembering to make sure we also install development headers for the libraries we're using:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libpython2.7-dev\nsudo pip install cython\n\nSince rotate_vector is a function we'll probably use somewhere else, we'll make a new file to hold it: utilities.pyx.  The \"x\" at the end signifies that this is a Cython file and not pure python.\nimport cython\nimport numpy as np\n\n\ndef rotate_vector_fast(vector, axis, angle):\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses Rodrigues rotation formula\n    axis must be a normal vector\n    \"\"\"\n    k = axis\n    v = vector\n    v_rot = (v * np.cos(angle) + np.cross(k, v) * np.sin(angle) +\n             k * (np.dot(k, v)) * (1 - np.cos(angle)))\n\n    return v_rot\n\nModify benchmark_rotate_vector.py to build and call our new Cython file:\nimport cProfile as profile\nfrom numpy import radians, array\nfrom kinematics.inverse.platform_ik import rotate_vector\nimport pyximport\npyximport.install()\nfrom kinematics.inverse.utilities import rotate_vector_fast\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    e_v = array([1, 0, 0])\n    gy_v = array([0, 1, 0])\n    angle = radians(10)\n\n    profile.run(\"for i in range(10000): rotate_vector(e_v, gy_v, angle)\")\n    profile.run(\"for i in range(10000): rotate_vector_fast(e_v, gy_v, angle)\")\n\n\nRunning the benchmark, rotate_vector and rotate_vector_fast take 0.379 and 0.377 ms respectively.  That's not a great improvement.  What happened to our compiled-langauge performance?  To create sigificant improvements, Cython needs to have some more information.  Cython has a great utility to help track down where we're getting Python performance vs. C performance.  Running cython -a code/kinematics/inverse/utilities.pyx generates an HTML report, where lines highlighted in yellow have heavy Python overhead.\n\nLines 12 and 13 have a lot of overhead.  The first thing we can try is using native C calls for the trig. functions, rather than numpy's.\nimport cython\nimport numpy as np\n\n\ncdef extern from \"math.h\":\n    double sin(double x)\n    double cos(double x)\n\n\ndef rotate_vector_fast(vector, axis, angle):\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses Rodrigues rotation formula\n    axis must be a normal vector\n    \"\"\"\n    k = axis\n    v = vector\n    v_rot = (v * cos(angle) + np.cross(k, v) * sin(angle) +\n             k * (np.dot(k, v)) * (1 - cos(angle)))\n\n    return v_rot\n\nThe cdef statement is used to declare C functions and variables.  The cdef extern at the beginning of the file is used to make the native C functions avaialable for use in both def functions (Python), and cdef functions (C).  Running the benchmark, the Cython implementation takes 0.347 seconds vs. 0.391 seconds for the native Python.  The profile information varies a bit on each run, but we're already seeing an improvement.\nNext we'll give Cython some information on our data types.  To use typing with the Numpy types, we need to cimport the module.  If you get errors about missing Numpy header files, you may need to modify benchmark file to look for the headers where they were actually installed to, rather than where Cython expects them by default:\npyximport.install(setup_args={'include_dirs': numpy.get_include()})\n\nHowever, if we try to build the following, we'll get errors:\nimport cython\nimport numpy as np\ncimport numpy as np\n\ncdef extern from \"math.h\":\n    double sin(double x)\n    double cos(double x)\n\n\ndef rotate_vector_fast(np.ndarray[np.float64_t, ndim=1] vector,\n                       np.ndarray[np.float64_t, ndim=1] axis,\n                       np.float64_t angle):\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses Rodrigues rotation formula\n    axis must be a normal vector\n    \"\"\"\n    k = &lt;np.float64_t*&gt; axis\n    v = &lt;np.float64_t*&gt; vector\n    v_rot = (v * cos(angle) + np.cross(k, v) * sin(angle) +\n             k * (np.dot(k, v)) * (1 - cos(angle)))\n\n    return v_rot\n\nFor performance, we've converted the input vectors into floating point vectors with very little overhead.   Unfortunately, that means we no longer have access to the basic Numpy array mathematical helpers.  All of these math operations can be rewritten:\nimport cython\nimport numpy as np\ncimport numpy as np\n\n\ncdef extern from \"math.h\":\n    double sin(double x)\n    double cos(double x)\n    double sqrt(double x)\n    double abs(double x)\n\n\ndef rotate_vector_fast(np.ndarray[np.float64_t, ndim=1] vector,\n                       np.ndarray[np.float64_t, ndim=1] axis,\n                       np.float64_t angle):\n    \"\"\"\n    Uses Rodrigues rotation formula\n    axis must be a normal vector\n\n    Implements:\n    v_rot = (v * np.cos(angle) + np.cross(k, v) * np.sin(angle) +\n             k * (np.dot(k, v)) * (1 - np.cos(angle)))\n    \"\"\"\n\n    v = &lt;np.float64_t*&gt; vector.data\n    k = &lt;np.float64_t*&gt; axis.data\n\n    # Cos-scaled component\n    cdef np.float64_t[3] cos_component\n    copy3v(cos_component, v)\n    scale3v(cos_component, cos(angle))\n\n    # Cross component\n    cdef np.float64_t[3] k_cross_v\n    cross3v(k, v, k_cross_v)\n    scale3v(k_cross_v, sin(angle))\n\n    # Last component\n    cdef np.float64_t[3] last_component\n    copy3v(last_component, k)\n    scale3v(last_component, dot3v(k, v))\n    scale3v(last_component, 1 - cos(angle))\n\n    # Result\n    cdef np.float64_t[3] result\n    copy3v(result, cos_component)\n    add3v(result, k_cross_v)\n    add3v(result, last_component)\n\n    v_rot = np.zeros(3)\n    v_rot[0] = result[0]\n    v_rot[1] = result[1]\n    v_rot[2] = result[2]\n\n    return v_rot\n\n\ncdef np.float64_t dot3v(np.float64_t* a, np.float64_t* b):\n    return a[0] * b[0] + a[1] * b[1] + a[2] * b[2]\n\ncdef void cross3v(np.float64_t* a, np.float64_t* b, np.float64_t* out):\n    out[0] = a[1] * b[2] - a[2] * b[1]\n    out[1] = a[2] * b[0] - a[0] * b[2]\n    out[2] = a[0] * b[1] - a[1] * b[0]\n\ncdef void scale3v(np.float64_t* v, np.float64_t gain):\n    v[0] = v[0] * gain\n    v[1] = v[1] * gain\n    v[2] = v[2] * gain\n\ncdef void copy3v(np.float64_t* dest, np.float64_t* src):\n    dest[0] = src[0]\n    dest[1] = src[1]\n    dest[2] = src[2]\n\ncdef void add3v(np.float64_t* accum, np.float64_t* delta):\n    accum[0] = accum[0] + delta[0]\n    accum[1] = accum[1] + delta[1]\n    accum[2] = accum[2] + delta[2]\n\nBecause we are working with vectors of a known, fixed length, rewritting the vector functions is straightfoward, if not elegant.  In order to get this to run, though, the benchmark must be modified:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    e_v = array([1., 0., 0.])\n    gy_v = array([0., 1., 0.])\n    angle = radians(10.)\n\n\t...\n\nIt's a subtle change.  All of the input varaibles now have a trailing \".\" to make sure Python represents them as a floating point number.  If we were pass in an integer value, Python would pass a \"long\" type to Cython.  Since we've optimized out the checks and conversions of types, this would crash the program.  For this inconvenience, though, we are rewarded by a large performance improvement: 26 ms in Cython vs. 367 ms in Python.  That's better than an order of magnitude improvement!  Rerunning cython -a, the mathematics no longer have significant overhead:\n\nWe still have a little bit of overhead in our conversion from C types back to a Numpy array, but we've hit the low-hanging fruit in this function.  This is just scratching the surface of what Cython can do.\nBack to the RPi\nLet's get our benchmark running on the RPi.  This requires a little leg-work, as the version of Cython pre-built for the RPi is too old.  First, I had to increase the size of the swap file to 1 GB by changing /etc/dphys-swapfile to have CONF_SWAPFILE=1024.  Then restart the swap file using the following:\n/etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop\n/etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start\n\nI was then able to build and install Cython using sudo pip install cython, though it took over an hour.\nBefore we run it on the more limited hardware, we want to make sure that the number of calls to each function-under-test is more conservative.  On my original RPi hardware, I only performed 100 calls for each: 22 ms in Cython and 346 ms in Python.  Although the overall performance is 100 times slower than my desktop, we are still getting a huge speed boost from Cython.\nFor convenience, I modified the benchmark to accept an argument with the number of times it should be run to make going between my desktop and RPi easier:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    e_v = array([1., 0., 0.])\n    gy_v = array([0., 1., 0.])\n    angle = radians(10.)\n\n    if len(sys.argv) &gt; 1:\n        runs = int(sys.argv[1])\n    else:\n        runs = 1\n\n    profile.run(\"for i in range(runs): rotate_vector(e_v, gy_v, angle)\")\n    profile.run(\"for i in range(runs): rotate_vector_fast(e_v, gy_v, angle)\")\nConclusions\nAfter repeating this process on a number of other functions in the inverse kinematics, there are signicant improvements.  Running servo_ik_benchmark.py now only takes 44 ms compared to 157 ms from when we stared.  After removing the profiling overhead, the printed dt is around 36 ms, less than half of what it was previously.  The following video shows the robot after optimization.\n\nWhile Python has significant challenges in real-time systems, the ability to write high-level code and then dive into optimization only when necessary is hard to over-emphasis for robotics applications.  Where other languages allow bindings to C libraries, Cython is a really cool system for not making you switch tool-chains mid-project.\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/deskbot-part-5-optimization/","title":"Deskbot Part 5, Optimization"},"https://superlou.github.io/dodge-card-soccer/":{"body":"Force a player to the last of his zones by striking him with a card (or other object) while the bottle-cap is in one of his own zones.

Each player initially starts with 4 zones under his control.\n\nThe boundary line is the where two opponent’s zones meet\nZones are not indefinitely controlled by a player, they are shifted back and forth according to (III)\n\n\nA player may take control of an enemy zone by:\n\nStriking an enemy with a live dodge-card without the opponent catching it\n\nA dodge-card is considered “live” if it is in flight\nAny card not moving or sliding along the ground is considered “dead”\nA flying dodge-card is still live after colliding with the walls, floor, ceiling, or another player\nIf a card leaves the field it is considered dead and may be returned to the intersection of the two player’s territories at the official’s discretions\n\n\nCatching an enemy thrown dodge-card that is live\n\nHolding an enemy thrown dodge-card above the floor with the card in direct contact of the wall or ceiling is known as “pinning”\nA pinned card is considered dead, and, once released or freely held by the player who had pinned it, is not considered a catch or a strike and play continues\nA live card thrown by the opponent that is supported only by the player’s body is considered a catch.  A player may be in contact with the walls at time of the catch as long as the card in question is not\n\n\nAn enemy violates the boundary between the two territories\n\nA player’s territory is violated if an opponent touches the floor of any of the player’s zones\nAn opponent may reach across the boundary and make contact only with a dodge-card that lies partially in both opponent’s zones\n\n\nMethods (a) and (b) may are only valid for a player while the puck lies in the opponent’s territory (i.e. a player must first move the puck into his enemy’s territory before attempting to strike him with a dodge-card). A strike or catch do no not effect play if made by the player with the puck in his territory.\n\nThe puck may be struck by dodge-cards accidentally or intentionally\n\n\nDodge-cards may be deflected using another dodge-card. The player may drop the shielding dodge-card in the process of deflecting. Neither case is considered a strike.\n\n\nWhen a player is awarded control of an adjacent enemy zone by the methods outlined in (III) the opponent may place the puck anywhere in the territories he still controls. Play continues as soon as the opponent kicks the pick across the new boundary line.\n\nWhile it is not necessary to mark the current boundary line as it will shift often, it may be as long as the markings are unobtrusive to play\n\n\nWhen a player controls all of the zones except one remaining to his opponent         (III) does not apply to him\n\n(III) continues to apply to the player in his last zone\nThe player with the majority of zones may win the round by moving the puck so it hits the wall in back of his opponent\n\nA player may not win a round without controlling all but one zones\nStriking an opponent with a card does not allow the player to win the round\nIf the opponent legally strikes the player trying to win the round he gains the adjacent cell of his enemy as usual and is now no longer in danger of loosing the round. Play continues as usual.\n\n\n\n\nViolations and Misconducts\n\nWarnings – A player accruing two warnings of any type in the same round surrenders a zone along the boundary line to his opponent. This process continues for every two consecutive warnings. All warnings (unless otherwise stated) may be given at any point of play. Play stops after a warning is given. Play is restarted by giving the player who did not earn the warning control of the puck.\n\nHandling – player willfully or accidentally contacts the puck with his wrist or hand\nStepping – player crosses the boundary in a minor fashion (unintentional). If directly results in a strike or catch, the strike or catch are invalidated and play continues.\nBounding – using the walls of the field to remain in off the floor longer than appropriate when dodging\nFilibustering – Allowing the puck and all dodge-cards to remain in the player’s own territory for longer than 5 seconds\n\n\nMinor Fouls – Minor fouls result in an automatic loss of the current round\n\nObjective Misconduct – intentional violation of a matter of play\nPersonal Misconduct – improper treatment of a player, referee, equipment, or field\nAccrue 6 or more warnings in a round\n\n\nMajor Fouls – Result in a loss of the game\n\nAccrue 2 or more minor fouls in a game\nWillful and destructive behavior not in conjunction with the appropriate nature of play and sportsmanship\n\nMust be called by a referee and confirmed by two separate referees or officials\n\n\n\n\nThe referee has all jurisdiction in applications of the rules.\n\n\n\nExample Game\nThe following is an example depicting the play of a single round of a game of Dodge-card soccer.\nEach player starts with their 4 zones, dividing the field into two territories with a boundary line at their intersection:\n\nThe red player wins the coin toss and chooses to have puck control in the first round. He kicks the puck over the line. The red player quickly attempts to strike the blue player and steps on the boundary line and earns a Stepping Warning. Play restarts giving the blue player control of the puck. He kicks it across the line and misses striking the red player. The red player kicks it back into blue territory and the blue player tries to catch but only deflects a dodge-card. The red player advances one zone:\n\nThe blue player kicks off and play continues until the red player kicks the puck into the blue territory and strikes the blue player:\n\nThe blue player kicks off and launches the puck into the air where the red player hits it with his hand by reaction, earning a Handling Warning. Being the second warning for the red player in this round, the blue player gains a zone and is given puck control:\n\nThe blue player kicks off but the red player eventually kicks the puck into blue territory and strikes the blue player:\n\nAgain the blue player kicks off and is legally struck:\n\nThe blue player kicks the puck but steps over the boundary line, earning a Stepping Warning. The red player is given puck control and the blue player fails to block the initial kick which hits the wall in back of him. The red player wins round 1.\nThe game has one more round in which the field is again divided and the blue player is given puck control.\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/dodge-card-soccer/","title":"Dodge-Card Soccer"},"https://superlou.github.io/implementing-comparators-with-hysteresis/":{"body":"You need to implement a comparator circuit with hysteresis, and you pull up some app notes.  They look something like this, credit to Analog Devices:\n\n\nIf you have a circuit in hand, there are a dozen or so discussions online to determine the comparator’s characteristics: high threshold $V_{TH}$, low threshold $V_{TL}$, and hysteresis $V_{HYST}$.  We asume that $R_{PULL-UP}$ is reasonably small compared to the feedback network so that $V_{OH}$ is fixed.  These equations are pretty easy to derive yourself from basic circuit principles, but it’s a time saver to have them available.  Now, if you want to design your comparator circuit, and already know it’s characteristics, you have to either guess and check values, implement a solver, or do some basic algebra to solve the equations to get the resistor values in terms of the comparator’s characteristics.  Every time I do this, I lose my notes, so this time, they’re going online.\nAssumptions\nGoing into these solutions, we’re going to assume that the circuit designer knows the following:\n\n$V_{TH}$\n$V_{TL}$\n$V_{HYST}$ – the difference between $V_{TH}$ and $V_{TL}$\n$V_{OH}$ – the voltage at pin 2 when the output is high.  For comparators with an open-comparator output and a small $R_{PULL-UP}$ with respect to the feedback network, this will be $V_{PULL-UP}$\n$V_{OL}$ – the voltage at pin 2 when the output is low.  For comparators with an open-ground output, this will be 0 or near 0.\nI’m going to assume that $V_{PULL-UP}$ is tied to $V_{CC}$.\n\nAlso, you will be picking some resistor values to make the equations solvable.  They are somewhat arbitrary, but should be chosen as a trade-off between wasting current making the feed-back network to small with respect to $V_{PULL-UP}$.  If you are designing on a PCB, choosing resistors that are too large may lead to PCB leakage having a significant effect on accuracy.\nSingle-supply Noninverting Hysteresis\nThis is the easiest of the two comparator types because the hysteresis equation is dependent only on $R_3$ and $R_4$.  Choosing an arbitrary $R_3$, we have:\n$$\nR_4 = \\frac{R_3(V_{OH}-V_{OL})}{R_4}\n$$\nThen, we can do some math to determine $V_{REF}$ as a function of the trip-point, which is halfway between $V_{TH}$ and $V_{TL}$.  Note that $V_{REF}$ is not the same as $V_{TRIP}$.\n$$\nV_{REF} = \\frac{ 2 R_4 V_{TRIP} + R_3(V_{OH}+V_{OL}) }{ 2R_3 + 2 R_4 }\n$$\nOnce you have $V_{REF}$, finding $R1$ and $R2$ is just solving a voltage divider.  Choosing an arbitrary $R1$:\n$$\nR_2 = R_1\\left(\\frac{V_{CC}}{V_{REF}}-1\\right)\n$$\nSingle-supply Inverting Hysteresis\nThis one is more aggravating because the hysteresis feedback and trip voltage networks interact.  The trick (there might be a better one) is to rearrange $V_{TL}$ and $V_{TH}$ like so:\n$$\nV_{TH} = \\frac{R_1 R_3 V_{CC} + R_1 R_2 V_{OH}}{R_1 R_2 + R_1 R_3 + R_2 R_3}\nV_{TL} = \\frac{R_1 R_3 V_{CC} + R_1 R_2 V_{OL}}{R_1 R_2 + R_1 R_3 + R_2 R_3}\n$$\nThen you can divide these equations to end up with $R_2$ and $R_3$ being your only unknowns:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{TH}}{V_{TL}} = \\frac{ R_3 V_{CC} + R_2 V_{OH} }{ R_3 V_{CC} + R_2 V_{OL} }\n$$\nYou end up with:\n$$\nR_3 = \\frac{R_2(V_{TL}V_{OH}-V_{TH}V_{OL})}{ V_{CC}(V_{TH} – V_{TL}) }\n$$\nWe can use this relationship to find $R_2$ in terms of only $R_1$:\n$$\nR_2 = R_1 \\left[\\frac{V_{CC}V_{HYST}(V_{OL}-V_{TL})}{V_{TL}(V_{TL}V_{OH}-V_{TH}V_{OL})}+\\frac{V_{CC} – V_{TL}}{V_{TL}}\\right]\n$$\nSo, choose $R_1$, then solve for $R_2$ and $R_3$ consecutively.\nHere’s pictures with the work if anyone’s curious or finds mistakes.\n\nNon-inverting\nInverting 1 of 3\nInverting 2 of 3\nInverting 3 of 3\n\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/implementing-comparators-with-hysteresis/","title":"Implementing Comparators with Hysteresis"},"https://superlou.github.io/installing-mplab-x-and-pickit2-on-ubuntu/":{"body":"In order to create the UAV flight control system from scratch, we’re going to need a microcontroller and a tool chain that is Linux compatible.  Since we know we’re going to be dealing with servo control signals, input capture (good for reading pulse widths), and PWM modules are going to be important in our device selection.  Microchip has a huge variety of microcontrollers available, and I have my eye on their dsPIC33 series because of the DSP hardware and variety of peripherals.  Also, I have some experience using them in previous hobby projects, as well as my Senior Design.  Best of all, I still have a PICkit2 emulator and PIC16F887 development board stashed away.\nInstallation\nDownload the installer from http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en-us/family/mplabx/#downloads. The installer is for both 64-bit and 32-bit systems, but if you are on a 64-bit system, you must first install the 32-bit compatibility libraries.\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nAllow executing the downloaded script and run it.\nchmod +x MPLABX-v1_70-linux-installer.run\nsudo ./MPLABX-v1_70-linux-installer.run\n\nFollow the fancy wizard. I installed to the default location (/opt/microchip/mplabx).\n\nThe wizard recommends rebooting after installation, but lets see how far we can get first. First, we’re going to install one of the compilers from http://www.microchip.com/MPLABxc. Since I’m interested in working with a PIC16F887 8-bit microcontroller, I’m going to install the XC8 compiler from http://www.microchip.com/mplabxc8linux.  You’ll need to mark the script executable and run it like we did for the IDE.  Make sure to configure the compiler in free mode.  We can activate the pro evaluation license down the road if desired, but it times out after 60 days.\nIf all goes well, when MPLAB X IDE is started (available in the launcher), it will indicate that it has found the compiler that was installed.\n\nOn Linux Mint with Cinnamon, I’m experiencing the symptoms described by https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/473, but I can worry about that later.\nConfiguration\nCreate a new “PIC16 C Template” project from the “Samples/Microchip Embedded” category. There may be some configuration loading errors because the default project wants the “hi-tech-picc” build tool-chain. Open the tool-chain configuration from Run –&gt; Set Project Configuration –&gt; Customize…\nClick Manage Configurations.., duplicate “XC8_PIC16F54,” and rename it to “XC8_PIC16F887.” Set it active. Select this new configuration from the Categories pane. In the configuration tab, change the family to Mid-Range 8-bit MCUs. Change the device to PIC16F887.  With the XC8 compiler installed, I get mostly green lights, and even the PICkit2 seems to be recognized.\n\nUse Run –&gt; Build Main Project to verify that the project can be successfully built. From Debug –&gt; Debug Main Project, I can enter emulation, and pause and restart the program. I had to OK MPLAB changing the configuration settings to meet:\nWatchdog Timer Enable bit = On\nLow Voltage Programming Enable bit = RB3/PGM pin has PGM function, low voltage programming enabled\nModifying the stock main.c file a bit, we can make LED 0 blink:\n/* Files to Include */\n#if defined(__XC)\n#include &lt;xc.h&gt; /* XC8 General Include File */\n#elif defined(HI_TECH_C)\n#include &lt;htc.h&gt; /* HiTech General Include File */\n#endif\n\n#include &lt;stdint.h&gt; /* For uint8_t definition */\n#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt; /* For true/false definition */\n\n#include \"system.h\" /* System funct/params, like osc/peripheral config */\n#include \"user.h\" /* User funct/params, such as InitApp */\n\n/* User Global Variable Declaration */\n#define _XTAL_FREQ 4000000 // Default internal oscillator frequency\n\n/* i.e. uint8_t &lt;variable_name&gt;; */\n\n/* Main Program */\nvoid main(void)\n{\n  /* Configure the oscillator for the device */\n  ConfigureOscillator();\n\n  /* Initialize I/O and Peripherals for application */\n  InitApp();\n\n  TRISD = 0; // Set port D as output\n\n  // Blink once per second\n  while(1)\n  {\n    PORTD=0x01;\n    __delay_ms(200);\n    PORTD=0x00;\n    __delay_ms(800);\n  }\n}\n\nConclusions\nThe installation and configuration for the PICkit2 was relatively painless. There are some configuration settings that need I haven’t resolved, but as a Linux microcontroller development toolchain, it seems competent. I prefer Eclipse-based IDEs over Netbeans, but the debugger integration is good and the IDE is certainly functional. It seems like there is support for the dsPIC33 series of microcontrollers, but I have to do some more research to know if they will work in MPLAB X with the PICkit2 or if a PICkit3 is necessary.\nI do have some reservations that there is no open source compiler from Microchip. Ian from Dangerous Prototypes does a more eloquent job of explaining the state of the compiler license. This isn’t necessarily a deal-breaker, but for now, I’m going to take a look at some other microcontroller vendors and tool-chains.\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/installing-mplab-x-and-pickit2-on-ubuntu/","title":"Installing MPLAB X and PICkit2 on Ubuntu"},"https://superlou.github.io/installing-robocup-soccer-simulator-on-ubuntu/":{"body":"\nNote: this tutorial is pretty old and should not be trusted.\n\nWhile it may have been obvious to some, installing the RoboCup Soccer Simulator (RCSS) got caught up on a number of snags. In order to make everyone else’s life easier, this tutorial steps through the installation process for RCSS with some notes and commentary I picked up along the way. While the development server was an Xubuntu virtual machine, this document should be largely applicable to typical Ubuntu installations.\nStep 1: Get the Necessary RCSS Packages\nYou will need the rcssbase, rcssserver, and rcssmonitor packages which are available at http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=24184. The versions used for this tutorial are 12.1.1, 12.1.3, and 12.1.0 respectively. Once downloaded, extract all three to a convenient location.\n\nAs much as I dislike working from the command prompt, we’re going to be using it pretty heavily during the install since we will be working with superuser priveleges. Open a terminal and navigate to your rcssbase directory. Once there, execute the configure script using sudo.\ncd RCSS/rcssbase-12.1.1/ sudo ./configure [enter sudo password]\n\nWhoops, I don’t have a C++ compiler yet. Using the Applications panel, open “System” -&gt; “Synaptic Package Manager”. Use the search tool to find the g++ Ubuntu package, mark it for install, and install it.\n\nSo lets try that again\nsudo ./configure [enter sudo password]\n\nWell, we made it farther. Turns out we need the Boost C++ libraries to compile RCSS. On top of this, the Ubuntu Boost package you can find in the Synaptic Package Manager doesn’t install all the Boost libraries you need. After banging my head on this for about an hour, I found some advice online and installed the additional Boost libraries at the command prompt. Once they are succesfully installed we can hopefully make it through configure.\nsudo apt-get install libboost-* sudo ./configure [enter sudo password]\n\n\nThe next step is to compile the rcssbase package.\nsudo make [enter sudo password]\n\n\nFinally, we install the package\nsudo make install [enter sudo password]\n\nI’ve added the screenshots for these steps to illustrate the final output of each of these steps, since it’s not too intuitive if you’ve succeeded or not. As a rule of thumb, compiling tends to fail in a big way. If you make it to gentle “Leaving directory” statements without rows and rows of errors, your likely ok. If you’re unsure, you can always read the output.\n\nThere’s one last thing we have to do before moving on. If you read through the output of the “make install” step, you will have noticed it complaining about libraries having been installed. To make these libraries accessible to other programs, we have two options. We can either list them in /etc/ld.so.conf, or we can create a file for listing RoboCup libraries inside the /etc/ld.so.conf.d directory. We’re going to go with that one since it keeps us out of an important system file.\ncd /etc/ld.so.conf.d sudo pico robocup.conf\n\nIn the file, we add two lines. One is to label the contents for our sake, and the other is to point to the directory make install was whining about.\n# RoboCup Soccer Simulator Libraries /usr/local/lib\n\nAfter saving our new file in Pico, we sudo run ldconfig to update our dynamic loader cache.\nStep 3 – Installing RCSS Server\nNow we walk through the same series of steps inside the rcssserver directory.\nsudo ./configure\nsudo make\nsudo make install\n\nI lucked out and didn’t have to add any more packages to compile and install, but if you hit a snag, just make sure to read the messages. Once you have successfully installed rcssserver, we need to add another line to our robocup.conf file\n# RoboCup Soccer Simulator Libraries\n/usr/local/lib\n/usr/local/lib/rcssserver/modules\n/\n\nAgain, sudo run ldconfig to update the dynamic loader cache.\n\nUnfortunately, we’re going to need more libraries before we can install the monitor package. We can use the Synaptic Package Manager to install the libxpm development packages.\n\nNow ./configure, make, make install that sucker. During the install, make threw-up many warnings. But so far I have ignored them and have not yet received punishment.\nStep 5 – Run, Hopefully\n\nWait.  I wasn't going to say anything when you skipped Step 2, but what happended to 4?\n\nOpen up two fresh terminals. In the first, type rcss followed by the tab key twice. If everything’s gone well, you should see a list of RCSS related programs we now have. Start the RCSS server running by entering “rcssserver”. There is no need to run the server with superuser privelages.\nIn your other terminal, start the RCSS monitor by entering rcssmonitor. Your first terminal should report a new monitor has connected. You can select “connect” in the rcssmonitor GUI and then “kick off” to see what happens if you had two teams of rocks make it to the World Cup. Connecting clients (soccer players) is for another tutorial.\n\nReferences\nHelp installing robocup server – http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=721261\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/installing-robocup-soccer-simulator-on-ubuntu/","title":"Installing RoboCup Soccer Simulator on Ubuntu"},"https://superlou.github.io/jumper-t8sg-v2-0-plus-review/":{"body":"The Jumper T8SG V2.0 Plus is a multi-protocol remotes with Hall-effect gimbals commonly available near the $100 (USD) price point. It supports the Bayang protocol without any additional modules, which is perfect for the E011C I’ve been flying. At this price, it is a very interesting option for those just getting into flying but tired of toy remotes.\n\nI ordered the Jumper T8SG V2.0 Plus from Banggood for $108.11, including shipping insurance, and received it in under two weeks. I ordered the Mode 2 (left-hand throttle) variant in yellow. There is also a “carbon fiber” finished V2.0 Plus for a little bit more. Be careful that you are looking at the proper version, as there are non-V2.0, non-Plus, and “Lite” model also floating around.\nIf you are looking at a next step remote control, I didn’t see much below the $100 threshold that had great reviews. Around $40, Jumper makes a T8SG Lite, but it is much more bare bones. It has a toy gimbals, LCD instead of OLED display, fewer switches, no DIY box, smaller antenna, and a much more limited number of protocols. The FlySky FS-i6 (a.k.a Eachine i6, Turnigy TGY-i6) is also at a similar price as the Lite but has much more restricted radios, and I don’t know what my next drone might be.\nI’ve put together a 2-minute unboxing and pairing video demonstrating how easy it is to get flying with this remote and the budget drone I built earlier.\nWhat's Inside\n\nI received the remote in just under two weeks, and I was a little nervous that the minimalist packaging didn’t identify the specific T8SG model. However, a barcoded sticker on the side did identify the exact model, and the contained remote was marked with the proper silkscreens.\nA very basic quick start guide is included. The most useful information there is two links:\n\nhttp://www.jumper.xyz for a software configuration guide\nhttps://www.deviationtx.com for details on the supported protocols.\n\nThe remote itself is shipped inside a snug “carbon fiber” carrying case.\n\nThe included carrying case has a feel between nylon and styrofoam. While a bit flexible, it is stiff enough to protect the remote against light pressures, like when pressed in a backpack against other gear.\n\nSome accessories are packed in with the remote:\n\nJumper branded neck strap\nUSB Type A to mini USB cable\nAlternate battery pack for running on 3.7 V batteries (18650 batteries)\nPlastic centering lever and spring to optionally configure the throttle for self-centering\n\nFrom what I’ve read, the alternate battery pack and centering parts might be recent additions to the packaging of the yellow V2 Plus. The carbon fiber variant lists these items as part of the product. The remote itself was packed with foam spacers and wrapping, as well as protective film over the display.\nFirst Impressions\nI find holding the remote with a pinching or thumb grip very comfortable, and it is less bulky than older RC gear that I have used. I don’t have large hands, and be aware that it is smaller than some of its peers, like the Taranis Q X7. The Jumper also does not have rubber grips on the back that I’ve seen on pictures of the Taranis.\n\nAfter installing 4 AA batteries, the remote powers up with a very readable OLED display. The yellow-on-black contrast has been night and day compared to LCD display remotes I’ve used. Because I mostly use the remote indoors, I haven’t tried it under peak daylight conditions. It has been easily readable, though, when I flew outside.\n\nThere are a few rattles on this budget remote. The navigation buttons can wiggle in the chassis, though only if you’re looking for problems. The “DIY Box” on the back of the remote seats loosely, but a thin piece of self-stick weather stripping fixes the knocking sound it makes.\n\nThe switches and buttons actuate crisply, and the gimbals feel very smooth. The throttle travel slides a little more loosely than other remotes, but not so loose as to be an issue.\n\nOn the bottom left of the remote, the “enter” button is above the “back” button, and significantly smaller, which took some getting used to. The navigation menus are easy to decipher.\nPairing\nThe remote integrates four RF modules: CC2500, CYRF6936, A7105, NRF2401. The loaded build of Deviation firmware (t8sg_v2_plus-v5.0.0-e801244) supports an impressive number of protocols: AFHDS-2A, ASSAN, Bayang, BlueFly, Bugs3, Bugs3Mini, CFlie, CG023, Corona, CRSF, CX10, DEVO, DM002, DSM2, DSMX, E012, E015, ESky, ESky150, Flysky, FQ777, Frsky, Frsky-V8, FrskyX, FY326, GW008, H377, H8-3D, HiSky, Hitec, HM830, HonTai, Hubsan4, iNAV, J6PRO, Joysway, KN, MJXq, MT99XX, PPM, Q303, S-FHSS, SBUS, Skyartec, SLT, SymaX, USBHID, V202, WFLY, WK2401, WK2601, WK2801, and YD717.\nPairing with my modified E011C was painless.\n\nEnter the “Model menu”\nEnter “Model setup”\nSelect a new “file”\nChange the model name to “E011C,” or whatever you prefer\nChange the model type to “Multi”\nSelect “Bayang” from the protocol list\nClick “Re-Init” once the drone is powered up.\n\nThe remote also attempts on power-up to bind with the last model selected, which is very convenient since I only have one quadcopter right now.\nConclusions\nFlying with the T8SG V2 Plus instead of the toy controller that comes with the E011C was a bigger difference than I expected. I have much better control authority, especially in the vertical axis. I’m by no means a good pilot, but some of the maneuvers I’ve seen online feel achievable with practice, rather than magic. I also can go back to a “pinch” grip which is what I’m used to from other RC aircraft.\nSince the remote is running Deviation firmware, there is a full package of custom mixing settings that I have yet to go through. This allows an incredible amount of configuration, even without using the USB connection. I set a flight timer based on the position of toggle switch G, and positioned it on the screen, while decluttering some items from the screen I didn’t need.\nIn the end, the T8SG V2 Plus is about future proofing my remote without breaking the bank. A full-sized remote is like learning to fly the quadcopter all over again, but in a good way.\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/jumper-t8sg-v2-0-plus-review/","title":"Jumper T8SG V2.0 Plus Review"},"https://superlou.github.io/kodi-infrared-remote-and-cinnamon-linux-17-1/":{"body":"Back in 2013, I programmed an inexpensive media remote to control XBMC on Ubuntu with the help of a cheap infrared PC remote control.

Playing around with the remote, you can use it almost like a full keyboard and mouse, if you are patient enough to type via cellphone-multi-tap-esque entry.\nAssigning Functions\nThe media control keys seemed to work automatically with XBMC, and the universal remote had no difficulty learning them.\nThe action of the 5×3 grid of keys is handled on the receiver side.  Pressing the up-arrow/2abc key always sends the same IR signal, but depending on the mode of the current mod of the receiver (toggled by the Numlock key), determines the command seen by the computer.  This means that you need to pick which mode you will use with XBMC, as there’s no great way to handle mode switching on the universal remote.  I opted to set the receiver in “white silkscreen mode.”  This gives you access to the arrow keys, enter key, tab, backspace, and escape, which already have context in XBMC.  The function assignments I came up with are in the following table:\n\nNote: looks like an upgrade lost my table. :(\n\n[table id=1 /]\nI’m a big fan of using the default controls whenever possible, but I ran out of white silkscreen commands on the PC Remote. I taught the E-mail button of the PC Remote to the Menu key of the universal remote.  Then, I mapped the launch_mail “key” in XBMC by creating a keymap file in the XBMC configuration directory.  On a standard Ubuntu/Mint install, it is ~/.xbmc/userdata/keymaps/, so I created a new file called pc-remote.xml in that directory with the following contents:\n&lt;keymap&gt;\n  &lt;global&gt;\n    &lt;keyboard&gt;\n      &lt;launch_mail&gt;ContextMenu&lt;/launch_mail&gt;\n    &lt;/keymap&gt;\n  &lt;/global&gt;\n&lt;/keyboard&gt;\n\nThe full list of keys available for XBMC mapping is available on the XBMC wiki, including the names of media remote keys like launch_mail.\nRCRP05BR Key Learning Procedure\nFor convenience, here’s the procedure for learning a key on the universal remote:\n\nPress and hold SETUP until the last-selected mode key blinks twice, then press 9 7 5.\nPress a mode key once (TV, DVR, CBL, DVD, AUD) to assign a mode for learning.\nPress the desired key on the RCRP05B once to put the remote in listening mode for the pressed key.\nPoint the teaching remote at the learning remote about 2″ apart.\nPress (hold if necessary) the button on the teaching remote to be taught.\nRepeat steps 2 through 5 for each key you want to learn.  Press and hold SETUP until the active mode key blinks twice to exit programming.\n\nUsing Global Volume Lock\nIt looks like the instructions for assigning the volume controls of one device to multiple devices are incorrect in the RCRP05BR’s manual.  The correct instructions are at hifi-remote.com’s wiki, and follow below:\n\nPress the the mode key of the volume controls we want to assign to other modes.\nPress and hold SETUP until the mode key blinks twice, then press 9 3 3.\nPress each mode where you want the audio buttons (volume, mute) to follow the mode from step 1.\nPress SETUP.  The mode from step 1 should blink twice.\n\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/low-cost-universal-remote-for-xbmc-on-ubuntu/","title":"Low Cost Universal Remote for XBMC on Ubuntu"},"https://superlou.github.io/one-time-pad-generator/":{"body":"Let's combine elementary school cryptography with popular social messaging services.

The remaining cards in the deck are placed face down in the center of each players’ fields. As cards are drawn from the deck, they may be discarded right next to it. Any number of people may play, just adapt the field to suit the number of players.\n\nOrder of play\nIn our example game with four players, the game progresses in sets. The order of each player in each set is determined by drawing from the deck. The player with the highest draw moves first, followed by the second highest draw, with play continuing in the same direction until everyone has made his or her moves for the set. After all players have gone, everyone draws again and the process continues. When only two players remain, there is a final draw by each player, and the highest drawer goes first and the two alternate until the end of the game. There is no longer any more drawing to determine order.\nThe player’s turn\nA player’s turn is split into three phases: Summon/Swap, Attack, and Movement (conveniently remembered through the acronym SAM). They must be taken in this order. All phases are optional but must be taken in the prescribed order. The only variation in the three phases is with the very first turn of the entire game, which does not have an attack phase. Let’s break down the three phases to see what they do:\n1. Summon/Swap\nAssume we are starting with six face down cards in our field in front of us. At the beginning of every turn each player is given 5 summon points to use to flip up cards. These are NOT accumulative between turns. This means a player can flip up a 2 through a 5 on any given turn, any card with a summon cost less than or equal to 5. To summons cards with a higher summon cost, already face up cards may be flipped down to add their face value to the 5 summon points of their turn. The face value of a card is the same as the number printed on them. Face cards run 11 through 14, Jack through Ace relatively. A card may only be flipped up once and down once in a turn, not necessarily in that order. As many cards as the player desires (within his own field) can be manipulated to draw on enough summon points. Extra summon points are eliminated at the end of the summon/swap phase of the player’s turn. If a player chooses to swap, the may put ONE face-down card face-up in the discard pile and replace that same position with a face-down card drawn from the deck. A player may choose to EITHER summon or swap in this phase of play.\n2. Attack\nEach player may attack once per turn using the following process. If the player decides to attack during his turn, he first declares which card he is attacking with. The player then draws a card from the deck and immediately discards it. It’s value determines the amount of attack points available this turn to the player. If it is higher or equal to the attack cost, usually a card’s face value, of the card the player wants to attack with, the player may now choose which card of an opponent he desires to attack. If it is lower, the player may flip down face-up cards on the field and add their value to the drawn card to gain enough attack points to be equal or greater than the attack cost they must pay. Most cards may only attack from the front of their field to the front of another’s field. A player may attack both face up and face down cards. We can now refer to cards as attacking and defending. The attacking card is always under the control of the player whose turn it is while the defending card can be controlled by any other player in the game. If a higher real value attacking card attacks a defending face-up card, the defender is sent to the discard pile and the space on the opponent’s field is now empty. If a lower real value attacking card attacks a defending face-up card, the attacker is flipped down and nothing happens to the defender. If a higher real value attacking card attacks a defending face-down card, the defender is forcibly flipped up and sent to the discard. If a lower real value attacking card attacks a defending face-down card, the defender is forcibly flipped up and the attacker is flipped down. When cards are forcibly flipped up, their owner is not required to pay anything or have any number of points or requirements. If the real value of two cards is the same, players may use a physical challenge as determined by the other players. These could include rock/paper/scissors, evens/odds, coin flip, triathlon, etc.. The winner’s card succeeds in either attacking or defending.\n3. Movement\nThe last phase of the player’s turn allows him or her the option of either swapping the positions of two face-down cards, or moving one face-down card to an open position. Face-up cards may NOT be moved.\nEach player must follow the above order of phases although any or all of the phases are optional. A player may not go more than three turns without performing a Summon/Swap or Attack.\nWhen all of a player’s back row or front row are eliminated from a row, all positions are treated as a front row for that player. This player may only regain the ability to use two rows if he or she gains four cards by having an opponent forcibly flip up a heart.\nIf the deck runs out, reshuffle the discard pile and place it upside down as a new deck.\nCard Special Modifiers\nThese apply to cards in various situations, from attacking/defending to determining then necessary attack points to function\n\nSuit Modifiers (apply to cards of a suit):\nClubs – has a summon cost 2- face value, has an attack cost 2+ face value\nHearts – if forcibly flipped up and destroyed a new card is drawn and replaces the card at the position it was destroyed, if forcibly flipped up and not destroyed, a new card is drawn and placed in an open position of the heart’s owner\nSpades – must attack over a row, may not attack from adjacent rows (ex: may attack an opponents back field from their owners front field or an opponents front field from their owner’s back row)\nDiamonds – have a real value 2+ their face value when defending and have a real value 2- their face value when attacking\nFace Modifiers (apply to face cards)\nIn a conflict between two face cards, the card with the higher real value has its real value decreased by 2. If both cards are equal real value, nothing happens. (ex: Jh attacking Qc, Jack destroys queen because the Jack has a real value of 11, while Queen’s value in this case become 10, two less than its initial 12)\nNumber modifiers (apply to specific face valued cards)\nFace value 2 – if already face up, the card may be used at the beginning of an attack phase or any time when defending time to boost the real value of another card by 2. If used with an attacking card that fails to destroy the targeted card, it is flipped down with the attacking card. If used with a defending card that is destroyed, it is not destroyed but is flipped down.\n\nTerms\nFace value – the number printed on a card or what would be assigned to it if numbering continued (7h = 7, 9d = 0, Jc = 11, Qd = 12, Kh = 13, Ad = 14)\nReal value – value of a card after its special modifiers are applied to its face value\nSummon cost – the amount of summon points required to flip up a card, usually a card’s face value\nAttack cost – the amount of attack points required to start an attack\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/oppugn/","title":"Oppugn"},"https://superlou.github.io/pages/":{"body":"","id":"https://superlou.github.io/pages/","title":""},"https://superlou.github.io/replacing-the-a-c-blower-resistor-on-a-2009-ford-escape/":{"body":"The A/C system of the Ford Escape has a resistive sensing element used regulate the blower motor.  If you find that the A/C blows air on some fan speeds but not others, it is likely that the blower motor resistor has burned out or otherwise failed.  On my 2009 Escape, the blower motor would run in positions 3 and 4, but not 1 or 2.  Based on other reports online, failing for the low speed settings seems to be the most common symptom.\n\nReplacing the resistor on the 2009 is cheap and simple, but since I could only find photos for the 2008 Escape, I took some pictures while my dad and I replaced the part.  I replaced the defective resistor with a CARQUEST RU1133 from Advanced Auto Parts though it is available from multiple distributors.

The latest challenge has been tuning the retraction settings to minimize the amount of stringy material carried by the nozzle as it moves between positions.  Note that this printer uses a Bowden extruder.  The values that worked for me should not be used for a direct feed extruder.\n\nThe printer has the following configuration:\n\nFirmware - Marlin 1.1.0-RC6\nHost Software - Repetier Host 1.6.2\nSlicer - Curaengine\nMaterial - Hatchbox 1.75 mm PLA, white\nTemperature - 200°C, this might have been a little hot given the glossiness of the prints\n\nThere are primarily two settings that affect retraction:\n\nDistance - how far the filament is pulled back into the extrusion head\nSpeed - how fast the filament is pulled back into the extrusion head\n\nI first disabled all retraction by setting both distance and speed to 0.  Using vector's retract/ooze test model from Thingiverse, I printed the base case (twice):\n\nYou can see that the stringing is severe between the towers.  I then printed an array of tests, increasing the retraction distance and speed:\n\nFrom these trials, I've been using 6mm and 80 mm/s, since it seems to be the point where there is minimal further reduction in stringing.  The printer seems to be significantly more sensitive to changes in retraction distance than retraction speed.  These values worked for me using a Bowden extruder, which typically requires a longer retraction distance compared to a direct feed extruder.  When calibrating your own printer, remember to start small and only change one variable at a time, increasing the retraction length by small amounts.  If I did this again, I'd probably increase by 1 mm per step rather than 2 to find the smallest retraction distance that minimizes stringing.\nHowever, I still have some issues with warts as the print head moves, though I don't know if those can be fixed through improved retraction settings.  You can see the warts between the tail and the back of the body.\n\nBased on some feedback online, I ran a series of temperature tests using a more complicated model, hoping that the fine features would provide more insight.  Each print was run with 6 mm, 80 mm/s retraction:\n\nThe results were less dramatic than I expected, and the small changes are hard to see from the pictures.  There was no sign of delamination or poor adhesion down to 185°C.  There was a small improvement in the \"fingers\" along the near-left side of the print as the temperature was decreased.  Somewhat counterintuitively, stringing seemed to become worse as the temperature decreased.  At the lowest temperature, there were significantly more surface imperfections compared to 190°C, so that's what I've decided to use for this filament.\nDoes anyone have any tips on what to try next?\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/retraction-calibration/","title":"3D Printer Retraction Calibration"},"https://superlou.github.io/setting-up-libgdx-on-ubuntu-13-04/":{"body":"I recently received an Ouya and want to try coding a game for it. While the favorite child for Ouya developments seems to be Unity3D, the Unity IDE cannot be run on Linux.  While there are a huge set of frameworks and game engines for developing on Android, I didn’t want to have to do game testing entirely via an Android Virtual Device or by loading onto a phone.  Fortunately, libGDX provides a cross platform framework that should let me do most of the testing in on my PC.\nSetup\nCreate a libGDX Project in Android Developer Tools.\nThe libGDX wiki has a list of prerequisites but instead of using standalone Eclipse and installing the Android SDK, we’re going to use the Android Developer Tools Bundle which contains an IDE (based on Eclipse) with the Android SDK already bundled and configured.  When dealing with many Eclipse plugins and environments targeting very specific tool-chains, I find that the seperate Eclipse instances make configuration easier to debug.  Get the ADT Bundle from downloads.  I’m using the 64-bit bundle with the build suffix 20130522.  Unzip it into a folder like ~/ouya.\nStart ADT at ~/ouya/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20130522/eclipse/eclipse, and install the Google Web Toolkit Plugin into ADT.  You will need to follow the instructions from https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/install-eclipse-4.2 to get the version compatible with Eclipse 3.8 which is what ADT is currently built on.  If you are using a later version of ADT, you may need to point at a different installation site.\n\nClick next, agree to the licenses, and install.\nDownload the libGDX SDK from the stable releases.  I am using version 0.9.8.  I unzipped it into ~/ouya.  Set the executable bit on gdx-setup-ui.jar, and run it using a JDK runtime.  The GUI should start.\n\nCreate a project and configure it as befits your project.  Mine is about boats.\n\nIf the LibGDX library listed under required libraries is red, download it by clicking on the “download latest stable version” icon.  Once you get the pleasant “Your Configuration is valid” notification, click on “Open the generation screen.”  Click “Launch!” to generate your projects.\n\nBack in ADT, we can import our new projects.  In the ADT menu bar, choose File &gt; Import… and from the General folder, select “Existing Projects into Workspace.”  Press next, and set the root directory to the location of your libGDX projects.\n\nAfter the import, I had a build error on the boats-android project.  To resolve it, edit the project’s properties and select an Android Build Target.\n\nI also had a build error on the boats-html project which was fixed by selecting the GWT SDK to be added to the project’s build path.\n\nRun the Project\nAndroid\nSelect the android project, and chose run from the menu.  If you receive a “No active compatible AVD’s or devices found…” error, edit the project’s run configurations and select an Android Virtual Device.\n\nIf you don’t  have an AVD, create one.  Click run, and wait (possibly for a few minutes) for the AVD to start.  If successful, you should see the application start up.\n\nI was also able to run the application on my phone, though I haven’t figured out how to take a picture of my phone with my phone.\nDesktop\nSelect the desktop project and run as a Java Application.\n\nHTML5\nWhen you run the html project, a development server will start with a link to open the game in the browser.  Firefox will alert that “Development Mode requires the Google Web Toolkit Developer Plugin.”  Install the plugin, and after Firefox restarts, you should see the default game.\n\nConclusion\nIt sure looks like libGDX is running cross-platform, as promised.  I’m going to have to learn some Android programming to see if I can find any gotchas, but so far it looks good.  The next step is to try loading the game onto my Ouya.

Additionally, they provide a strong holding torque.  This can make them useful in applications where you want to rotate the motor precisely without employing encoders.  When prototyping, I like to use development boards that can be transferred to a custom PCB easily.  This gives me a clear path if I want to move the design from the Protoboard to something more polished.\n\nHere’s the parts list:\n\nPololu DRV8825 carrier\n57oz-in 1Nm NEMA 17 Stepper Motor 1.3A 40mm for CNC router or mill\n100 Pcs 25V 100uF 105C Radial Lead Electrolytic Capacitors\nRaspberry Pi Model A (256MB) – I had a Model A laying around, but you should be able to use the Model B with a little modification\nAdafruit Pi Cobbler Breakout Kit for Raspberry Pi – Assembled! – If you are using the Model B, you may want the breakout for the full model B GPIO header\nHiMart New DC 12V 3A Switching Power Supply Adapter For 110V- 240V AC 50/60Hz 2.1mm With HiMart Robbin\n\nWait.  Didn’t you say that you wanted a clear path to an integrated PCB design?  Why use the Pi then?  You’ll be hard-pressed to design that SoC into your own design, or at the least, make a full Linux compatible single board PC.  Because I’m a hypocrite.  Maybe we’ll connect it to a joystick down the road, and this will make life easier.\nThe Circuit\nThe minimum number of connections are used for this proof-of-concept.  I’m using the pins labeled GPIO 7 and GPIO 8 in the Raspberry Pi documentation to control the DRV8825’s STEP and DIR inputs, respectively.\n\nMake sure to turn the DRV8825 carrier board’s potentiometer fully counter-clockwise.  This will severely limit the coil current, but prevent burn-out before we are ready to set this properly.\nThe Software\nThere are a few options for controlling the Pi’s GPIO pins.  I’m going to avoid the high-level libraries to get high-speed control of the IO pins. Joonas Pihlajamaa provides a through benchmark of the various options, showing that C is needed to get high-speed control of the GPIO.  We could probably write a Python wrapper around some C code to get achieve high speed control, but for simplicity, lets use the minimum needed to verify that our circuit is working.  The 3 files main.c, gpio.c, and gpio.h are all that is needed to get the motor turning.  It’s nearly identical to the RPi low-level peripheral example, though I wrapped some of the operations for convenience.\nThe project’s code is available on Github.\nThe Test\nTurn the potentiometer clockwise 20 degrees or so. With the Raspberry Pi header or 12 V supply disconnected, you should be able to rotate the stepper motor shaft by hand. With both connected, the DRV8825 will be enabled and the stepper will hold. The torque required to rotate the motor should feel much higher and you can hear a high pitched whine from motor, though the later varies with hold torque, age, and hearing damage. Follow Pololu’s procedure to adjust the power limiting via the potentiometer.\nThe test program must be executed with “sudo” or as root because it accesses /dev/mem. If everything works out, the motor should spin smoothly when you run the program.\n\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/simple-stepper-motor-control-with-raspberry-pi/","title":"Simple Stepper Motor Control with Raspberry Pi"},"https://superlou.github.io/smoothing-rates-of-change/":{"body":"This is probably something that would have been obvious to everyone else, but stumped me for a bit when I came across it the other day.  I was looking at the rate of change of a sequence, and my smoothing algorithm wasn’t doing any better than just subtracting two points in the sequence farther apart.  In fact, the results were identical.  This won’t be particularly rigorous, but I believe the concept is valid.\nDifference Between Points in a Sequence\nWe are looking at a set of samples $d[n]$, sampled at some set frequency.  Let’s create a new series which is the difference (delta) between every two consecutive points:\n$$\\Delta d[n] = d[n] - d[n-1]$$\n$\\Delta d[n]$ is the rate of change from one point to another, or can be thought of as the slope between the points.  Let’s generalize this for the case where we take the difference not between consecutive points, but between points spaced $s$ apart:\n$$\\Delta_s d[n] = \\frac{1}{s} \\left( d[n] - d[n-s] \\right)$$\nThe $\\frac{1}{s}$ is because, if you think in terms of slope, the spacing between your points has widened.  I’ll refer to this operation as taking the “spaced delta” of the sequence.  There’s probably a proper word for this, and I’m hoping someone will comment with it.\nThe Moving Average\nIn my application, the sequence $d[n]$ was the sampled positions of a device, and since I was more concerned with how fast it was moving, I was looking at $\\Delta_1 d[n]$, the rate of change.  Since this will be noisy when using real-world data, it needs to be smoothed.  An easy goto in the digital signal processing toolbox is the moving average.  You just average the past $w$ samples.  It’s relatively cheap so long as $w$ isn’t too large, and it is actually ideal for removing random noise while preserving step response.  Let’s define a moving average of our original sequence $d[n]$ as:\n$$M_w d[n] = \\frac{1}{w} \\left( d[n] + d[n-1] + d[n-2] + \\ldots + d[n-w] \\right)$$\nSmoothing the Rate of Change\nI want to smooth out our rate-of-change sequence, which looks like:\n$$\\Delta_1 d[n] = \\left[ \\ldots, d[n+2]-d[n+1], d[n+1]-d[n], d[n]-d[n-1], d[n-1]-d[n-2], d[n-2]-d[n-3], \\ldots  \\right]$$\nIf we plug these points into $M_w d[n]$ to average out the most recent $w$ points, we have:\n$$M_w \\left( \\Delta_1 d[n] \\right) = \\frac{1}{w} \\left( (d[n]-d[n-1]) + (d[n-1]-d[n-2]) + (d[n-2]-d[n-3]) + \\ldots + (d[n-w+1] – d[n-w]) \\right)$$\nThe neat thing is that all of the inner terms cancels out, leaving:\n$$M_w \\left( \\Delta_1 d[n] \\right) = \\frac{1}{w} \\left( d[n] - d[n-w] \\right)$$\nThis is identical to the spaced delta with a spacing equal to the length of the moving average:\n$$M_w \\left( \\Delta_1 d[n] \\right) = \\Delta_w d[n]$$\nWhy This is Important\nTrying to keep my terminology consistent, the special case of a spaced delta where the spacing is one is the rate of change of the system.  If you want to run a moving average on the rate of change of a sequence to smooth it, you can instead simply take the spaced delta of the original sequence with the spacing equal to what your moving average width would be.  This saves a large number of operations, and has less opportunity for errors to accumulate when you are working on systems with limited precision.\nTo note, I assumed that all of the operations needed to be causal, but I believe the result holds true without this so long as you are consistent.\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/smoothing-rates-of-change/","title":"Smoothing Rates of Change"},"https://superlou.github.io/vfr-flight-minimums/":{"body":"While studying for the Private Pilot Knowledge (Written) Test, I had a hard time memorizing the rules governing the minimum requirements for VFR in the difference airspaces.

Rather than styling with CSS, Underscores heavily recommends that you compile your stylesheets from LESS or SASS.  Since I have more familiarity with SASS, I’m going to go down that road.  However, either language should be compiled server side.  This blog is a low traffic learning experience, so I’m going to do all of my theme editing live (or on a testing subdomain) and not hosted locally.  It’s not great practice.\nAnyway, lets work with SASS on Bluehost.  Our first step is to get SSH access to the Bluehost server.  You can request SSH access from the Bluehost cPanel. Once we have access to our account over SSH, we’ll need to install some gems.  Fortunately, Bluehost has the RubyGem package manager installed.\ngem install sass\ngem install –version ‘~&gt; 0.9′ rb-inotify # provides better performance when polling the filesystem for changed files\n\nNow we watch the Bones library/scss folder for changes and automatically compile a new stylesheet:\ncd\n/wp-content/themes/\nsass –watch library/scss:library/css\n\nIf we’re successful, we can edit _base.scss, change the body background, and watch sass recompile.  Then refresh your demo site and see your changes.

It seemed to write the data but left the card unbootable by the RPi.  In addition, I couldn’t mount and view the contents in Ubuntu either.  Not sure why, though there’s probably something obvious I’m missing.  Instead, I found a lazier solution: using the Ubuntu Disks graphical tool.  Find your drive in the device list, stop it if necessary, and then use the “Restore Disk Image…” option from the actions cog button.\n\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/writing-a-raspberry-pi-image-using-the-ubuntu-diskutil/","title":"Writing a Raspberry Pi Image Using the Ubuntu DiskUtil"}},"docInfo":{"https://superlou.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://superlou.github.io/about/":{"body":18,"title":0},"https://superlou.github.io/animated-bugs-with-blender-and-tricaster/":{"body":368,"title":4},"https://superlou.github.io/budget-indoor-quadcopter/":{"body":517,"title":3},"https://superlou.github.io/building-a-uav/":{"body":201,"title":2},"https://superlou.github.io/checkinstall-vs-make-install/":{"body":29,"title":4},"https://superlou.github.io/converting-a-jquery-array-to-an-ember-array/":{"body":46,"title":5},"https://superlou.github.io/deskbot-part-1-architecture/":{"body":283,"title":4},"https://superlou.github.io/deskbot-part-2-hardware-prototype/":{"body":405,"title":5},"https://superlou.github.io/deskbot-part-3-forward-kinematics/":{"body":245,"title":5},"https://superlou.github.io/deskbot-part-4-inverse-kinematics/":{"body":1084,"title":5},"https://superlou.github.io/deskbot-part-5-optimization/":{"body":1682,"title":4},"https://superlou.github.io/dodge-card-soccer/":{"body":767,"title":3},"https://superlou.github.io/implementing-comparators-with-hysteresis/":{"body":330,"title":3},"https://superlou.github.io/installing-mplab-x-and-pickit2-on-ubuntu/":{"body":457,"title":5},"https://superlou.github.io/installing-robocup-soccer-simulator-on-ubuntu/":{"body":492,"title":5},"https://superlou.github.io/jumper-t8sg-v2-0-plus-review/":{"body":643,"title":5},"https://superlou.github.io/kodi-infrared-remote-and-cinnamon-linux-17-1/":{"body":130,"title":6},"https://superlou.github.io/low-cost-universal-remote-for-xbmc-on-ubuntu/":{"body":394,"title":6},"https://superlou.github.io/one-time-pad-generator/":{"body":20,"title":4},"https://superlou.github.io/open-folder-with-nemo/":{"body":21,"title":4},"https://superlou.github.io/oppugn/":{"body":801,"title":1},"https://superlou.github.io/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://superlou.github.io/replacing-the-a-c-blower-resistor-on-a-2009-ford-escape/":{"body":221,"title":7},"https://superlou.github.io/retraction-calibration/":{"body":274,"title":4},"https://superlou.github.io/setting-up-libgdx-on-ubuntu-13-04/":{"body":380,"title":5},"https://superlou.github.io/simple-stepper-motor-control-with-raspberry-pi/":{"body":337,"title":6},"https://superlou.github.io/smoothing-rates-of-change/":{"body":339,"title":3},"https://superlou.github.io/vfr-flight-minimums/":{"body":43,"title":3},"https://superlou.github.io/viewing-pdfs-in-chromium-on-linux-mint/":{"body":59,"title":5},"https://superlou.github.io/working-with-sass-on-bluehost/":{"body":210,"title":3},"https://superlou.github.io/writing-a-raspberry-pi-image-using-the-ubuntu-diskutil/":{"body":71,"title":7}},"length":32},"lang":"English"};
