other object) while the bottle-cap is in one of his own zones.  Or:\n\nWell, we ate all the pizza.  What are we going to do with the box, 2 liter bottle cap, and chem lab goggles?\n\nField Setup\nThe field is a walled rectangle 96 x 5 feet, divided every 12 feet with 7 dividing lines.\n\nEquipment\n\n1 Plastic-cap (puck)\n10 (minimum) Dodge-cards – Preferably Outback Steakhouse Bloomin’ Onion Coasters or other 4” square cardboards with rounded corners.\nCone or other marker (optional) used to mark current Zone Split\n\nSafety\nDue to the projectile-hucking nature of the game, this game should be played wearing chemistry goggles and a t-shirt like a ninja-mask.\n\nPlay is divided into two or more rounds: in the first round initial puck control is determined by the winner of a coin toss. In the second round the opposite player receives the puck at the start.\n\nThe winner of the toss may choose to retain initial control or forfeit it to his opponent\nIf he forfeits he will be given control at the start of the next round\nAfter the first two rounds, initial control alternates between players\n\n\nPlay begins by allowing the player having won initial puck control to position the puck anywhere in his territory. His territory consists of all the rectangular “zones” 12 x 5 feet. Each player initially starts with 4 zones under his control.\n\nThe boundary line is the where two opponent’s zones meet\nZones are not indefinitely controlled by a player, they are shifted back and forth according to (III)\n\n\nA player may take control of an enemy zone by:\n\nStriking an enemy with a live dodge-card without the opponent catching it\n\nA dodge-card is considered “live” if it is in flight\nAny card not moving or sliding along the ground is considered “dead”\nA flying dodge-card is still live after colliding with the walls, floor, ceiling, or another player\nIf a card leaves the field it is considered dead and may be returned to the intersection of the two player’s territories at the official’s discretions\n\n\nCatching an enemy thrown dodge-card that is live\n\nHolding an enemy thrown dodge-card above the floor with the card in direct contact of the wall or ceiling is known as “pinning”\nA pinned card is considered dead, and, once released or freely held by the player who had pinned it, is not considered a catch or a strike and play continues\nA live card thrown by the opponent that is supported only by the player’s body is considered a catch.  A player may be in contact with the walls at time of the catch as long as the card in question is not\n\n\nAn enemy violates the boundary between the two territories\n\nA player’s territory is violated if an opponent touches the floor of any of the player’s zones\nAn opponent may reach across the boundary and make contact only with a dodge-card that lies partially in both opponent’s zones\n\n\nMethods (a) and (b) may are only valid for a player while the puck lies in the opponent’s territory (i.e. a player must first move the puck into his enemy’s territory before attempting to strike him with a dodge-card). A strike or catch do no not effect play if made by the player with the puck in his territory.\n\nThe puck may be struck by dodge-cards accidentally or intentionally\n\n\nDodge-cards may be deflected using another dodge-card. The player may drop the shielding dodge-card in the process of deflecting. Neither case is considered a strike.\n\n\nWhen a player is awarded control of an adjacent enemy zone by the methods outlined in (III) the opponent may place the puck anywhere in the territories he still controls. Play continues as soon as the opponent kicks the pick across the new boundary line.\n\nWhile it is not necessary to mark the current boundary line as it will shift often, it may be as long as the markings are unobtrusive to play\n\n\nWhen a player controls all of the zones except one remaining to his opponent         (III) does not apply to him\n\n(III) continues to apply to the player in his last zone\nThe player with the majority of zones may win the round by moving the puck so it hits the wall in back of his opponent\n\nA player may not win a round without controlling all but one zones\nStriking an opponent with a card does not allow the player to win the round\nIf the opponent legally strikes the player trying to win the round he gains the adjacent cell of his enemy as usual and is now no longer in danger of loosing the round. Play continues as usual.\n\n\n\n\nViolations and Misconducts\n\nWarnings – A player accruing two warnings of any type in the same round surrenders a zone along the boundary line to his opponent. This process continues for every two consecutive warnings. All warnings (unless otherwise stated) may be given at any point of play. Play stops after a warning is given. Play is restarted by giving the player who did not earn the warning control of the puck.\n\nHandling – player willfully or accidentally contacts the puck with his wrist or hand\nStepping – player crosses the boundary in a minor fashion (unintentional). If directly results in a strike or catch, the strike or catch are invalidated and play continues.\nBounding – using the walls of the field to remain in off the floor longer than appropriate when dodging\nFilibustering – Allowing the puck and all dodge-cards to remain in the player’s own territory for longer than 5 seconds\n\n\nMinor Fouls – Minor fouls result in an automatic loss of the current round\n\nObjective Misconduct – intentional violation of a matter of play\nPersonal Misconduct – improper treatment of a player, referee, equipment, or field\nAccrue 6 or more warnings in a round\n\n\nMajor Fouls – Result in a loss of the game\n\nAccrue 2 or more minor fouls in a game\nWillful and destructive behavior not in conjunction with the appropriate nature of play and sportsmanship\n\nMust be called by a referee and confirmed by two separate referees or officials\n\n\n\n\nThe referee has all jurisdiction in applications of the rules.\n\n\n\nExample Game\nThe following is an example depicting the play of a single round of a game of Dodge-card soccer.\nEach player starts with their 4 zones, dividing the field into two territories with a boundary line at their intersection:\n\nThe red player wins the coin toss and chooses to have puck control in the first round. He kicks the puck over the line. The red player quickly attempts to strike the blue player and steps on the boundary line and earns a Stepping Warning. Play restarts giving the blue player control of the puck. He kicks it across the line and misses striking the red player. The red player kicks it back into blue territory and the blue player tries to catch but only deflects a dodge-card. The red player advances one zone:\n\nThe blue player kicks off and play continues until the red player kicks the puck into the blue territory and strikes the blue player:\n\nThe blue player kicks off and launches the puck into the air where the red player hits it with his hand by reaction, earning a Handling Warning. Being the second warning for the red player in this round, the blue player gains a zone and is given puck control:\n\nThe blue player kicks off but the red player eventually kicks the puck into blue territory and strikes the blue player:\n\nAgain the blue player kicks off and is legally struck:\n\nThe blue player kicks the puck but steps over the boundary line, earning a Stepping Warning. The red player is given puck control and the blue player fails to block the initial kick which hits the wall in back of him. The red player wins round 1.\nThe game has one more round in which the field is again divided and the blue player is given puck control.\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/dodge-card-soccer/","title":"Dodge-Card Soccer"},"https://superlou.github.io/implementing-comparators-with-hysteresis/":{"body":"You need to implement a comparator circuit with hysteresis, and you pull up some app notes.  They look something like this, credit to Analog Devices:\n\n\nIf you have a circuit in hand, there are a dozen or so discussions online to determine the comparator’s characteristics: high threshold $V_{TH}$, low threshold $V_{TL}$, and hysteresis $V_{HYST}$.  We asume that $R_{PULL-UP}$ is reasonably small compared to the feedback network so that $V_{OH}$ is fixed.  These equations are pretty easy to derive yourself from basic circuit principles, but it’s a time saver to have them available.  Now, if you want to design your comparator circuit, and already know it’s characteristics, you have to either guess and check values, implement a solver, or do some basic algebra to solve the equations to get the resistor values in terms of the comparator’s characteristics.  Every time I do this, I lose my notes, so this time, they’re going online.\nAssumptions\nGoing into these solutions, we’re going to assume that the circuit designer knows the following:\n\n$V_{TH}$\n$V_{TL}$\n$V_{HYST}$ – the difference between $V_{TH}$ and $V_{TL}$\n$V_{OH}$ – the voltage at pin 2 when the output is high.  For comparators with an open-comparator output and a small $R_{PULL-UP}$ with respect to the feedback network, this will be $V_{PULL-UP}$\n$V_{OL}$ – the voltage at pin 2 when the output is low.  For comparators with an open-ground output, this will be 0 or near 0.\nI’m going to assume that $V_{PULL-UP}$ is tied to $V_{CC}$.\n\nAlso, you will be picking some resistor values to make the equations solvable.  They are somewhat arbitrary, but should be chosen as a trade-off between wasting current making the feed-back network to small with respect to $V_{PULL-UP}$.  If you are designing on a PCB, choosing resistors that are too large may lead to PCB leakage having a significant effect on accuracy.\nSingle-supply Noninverting Hysteresis\nThis is the easiest of the two comparator types because the hysteresis equation is dependent only on $R_3$ and $R_4$.  Choosing an arbitrary $R_3$, we have:\n$$\nR_4 = \\frac{R_3(V_{OH}-V_{OL})}{R_4}\n$$\nThen, we can do some math to determine $V_{REF}$ as a function of the trip-point, which is halfway between $V_{TH}$ and $V_{TL}$.  Note that $V_{REF}$ is not the same as $V_{TRIP}$.\n$$\nV_{REF} = \\frac{ 2 R_4 V_{TRIP} + R_3(V_{OH}+V_{OL}) }{ 2R_3 + 2 R_4 }\n$$\nOnce you have $V_{REF}$, finding $R1$ and $R2$ is just solving a voltage divider.  Choosing an arbitrary $R1$:\n$$\nR_2 = R_1\\left(\\frac{V_{CC}}{V_{REF}}-1\\right)\n$$\nSingle-supply Inverting Hysteresis\nThis one is more aggravating because the hysteresis feedback and trip voltage networks interact.  The trick (there might be a better one) is to rearrange $V_{TL}$ and $V_{TH}$ like so:\n$$\nV_{TH} = \\frac{R_1 R_3 V_{CC} + R_1 R_2 V_{OH}}{R_1 R_2 + R_1 R_3 + R_2 R_3}\nV_{TL} = \\frac{R_1 R_3 V_{CC} + R_1 R_2 V_{OL}}{R_1 R_2 + R_1 R_3 + R_2 R_3}\n$$\nThen you can divide these equations to end up with $R_2$ and $R_3$ being your only unknowns:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{TH}}{V_{TL}} = \\frac{ R_3 V_{CC} + R_2 V_{OH} }{ R_3 V_{CC} + R_2 V_{OL} }\n$$\nYou end up with:\n$$\nR_3 = \\frac{R_2(V_{TL}V_{OH}-V_{TH}V_{OL})}{ V_{CC}(V_{TH} – V_{TL}) }\n$$\nWe can use this relationship to find $R_2$ in terms of only $R_1$:\n$$\nR_2 = R_1 \\left[\\frac{V_{CC}V_{HYST}(V_{OL}-V_{TL})}{V_{TL}(V_{TL}V_{OH}-V_{TH}V_{OL})}+\\frac{V_{CC} – V_{TL}}{V_{TL}}\\right]\n$$\nSo, choose $R_1$, then solve for $R_2$ and $R_3$ consecutively.\nHere’s pictures with the work if anyone’s curious or finds mistakes.\n\nNon-inverting\nInverting 1 of 3\nInverting 2 of 3\nInverting 3 of 3\n\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/implementing-comparators-with-hysteresis/","title":"Implementing Comparators with Hysteresis"},"https://superlou.github.io/installing-mplab-x-and-pickit2-on-ubuntu/":{"body":"In order to create the UAV flight control system from scratch, we’re going to need a microcontroller and a tool chain that is Linux compatible.  Since we know we’re going to be dealing with servo control signals, input capture (good for reading pulse widths), and PWM modules are going to be important in our device selection.  Microchip has a huge variety of microcontrollers available, and I have my eye on their dsPIC33 series because of the DSP hardware and variety of peripherals.  Also, I have some experience using them in previous hobby projects, as well as my Senior Design.  Best of all, I still have a PICkit2 emulator and PIC16F887 development board stashed away.\nInstallation\nDownload the installer from http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en-us/family/mplabx/#downloads. The installer is for both 64-bit and 32-bit systems, but if you are on a 64-bit system, you must first install the 32-bit compatibility libraries.\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nAllow executing the downloaded script and run it.\nchmod +x MPLABX-v1_70-linux-installer.run\nsudo ./MPLABX-v1_70-linux-installer.run\n\nFollow the fancy wizard. I installed to the default location (/opt/microchip/mplabx).\n\nThe wizard recommends rebooting after installation, but lets see how far we can get first. First, we’re going to install one of the compilers from http://www.microchip.com/MPLABxc. Since I’m interested in working with a PIC16F887 8-bit microcontroller, I’m going to install the XC8 compiler from http://www.microchip.com/mplabxc8linux.  You’ll need to mark the script executable and run it like we did for the IDE.  Make sure to configure the compiler in free mode.  We can activate the pro evaluation license down the road if desired, but it times out after 60 days.\nIf all goes well, when MPLAB X IDE is started (available in the launcher), it will indicate that it has found the compiler that was installed.\n\nOn Linux Mint with Cinnamon, I’m experiencing the symptoms described by https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/473, but I can worry about that later.\nConfiguration\nCreate a new “PIC16 C Template” project from the “Samples/Microchip Embedded” category. There may be some configuration loading errors because the default project wants the “hi-tech-picc” build tool-chain. Open the tool-chain configuration from Run –&gt; Set Project Configuration –&gt; Customize…\nClick Manage Configurations.., duplicate “XC8_PIC16F54,” and rename it to “XC8_PIC16F887.” Set it active. Select this new configuration from the Categories pane. In the configuration tab, change the family to Mid-Range 8-bit MCUs. Change the device to PIC16F887.  With the XC8 compiler installed, I get mostly green lights, and even the PICkit2 seems to be recognized.\n\nUse Run –&gt; Build Main Project to verify that the project can be successfully built. From Debug –&gt; Debug Main Project, I can enter emulation, and pause and restart the program. I had to OK MPLAB changing the configuration settings to meet:\nWatchdog Timer Enable bit = On\nLow Voltage Programming Enable bit = RB3/PGM pin has PGM function, low voltage programming enabled\nModifying the stock main.c file a bit, we can make LED 0 blink:\n/* Files to Include */\n#if defined(__XC)\n#include &lt;xc.h&gt; /* XC8 General Include File */\n#elif defined(HI_TECH_C)\n#include &lt;htc.h&gt; /* HiTech General Include File */\n#endif\n\n#include &lt;stdint.h&gt; /* For uint8_t definition */\n#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt; /* For true/false definition */\n\n#include \"system.h\" /* System funct/params, like osc/peripheral config */\n#include \"user.h\" /* User funct/params, such as InitApp */\n\n/* User Global Variable Declaration */\n#define _XTAL_FREQ 4000000 // Default internal oscillator frequency\n\n/* i.e. uint8_t &lt;variable_name&gt;; */\n\n/* Main Program */\nvoid main(void)\n{\n  /* Configure the oscillator for the device */\n  ConfigureOscillator();\n\n  /* Initialize I/O and Peripherals for application */\n  InitApp();\n\n  TRISD = 0; // Set port D as output\n\n  // Blink once per second\n  while(1)\n  {\n    PORTD=0x01;\n    __delay_ms(200);\n    PORTD=0x00;\n    __delay_ms(800);\n  }\n}\n\nConclusions\nThe installation and configuration for the PICkit2 was relatively painless. There are some configuration settings that need I haven’t resolved, but as a Linux microcontroller development toolchain, it seems competent. I prefer Eclipse-based IDEs over Netbeans, but the debugger integration is good and the IDE is certainly functional. It seems like there is support for the dsPIC33 series of microcontrollers, but I have to do some more research to know if they will work in MPLAB X with the PICkit2 or if a PICkit3 is necessary.\nI do have some reservations that there is no open source compiler from Microchip. Ian from Dangerous Prototypes does a more eloquent job of explaining the state of the compiler license. This isn’t necessarily a deal-breaker, but for now, I’m going to take a look at some other microcontroller vendors and tool-chains.\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/installing-mplab-x-and-pickit2-on-ubuntu/","title":"Installing MPLAB X and PICkit2 on Ubuntu"},"https://superlou.github.io/installing-robocup-soccer-simulator-on-ubuntu/":{"body":"\nNote: this tutorial is pretty old and should not be trusted.\n\nWhile it may have been obvious to some, installing the RoboCup Soccer Simulator (RCSS) got caught up on a number of snags. In order to make everyone else’s life easier, this tutorial steps through the installation process for RCSS with some notes and commentary I picked up along the way. While the development server was an Xubuntu virtual machine, this document should be largely applicable to typical Ubuntu installations.\nStep 1: Get the Necessary RCSS Packages\nYou will need the rcssbase, rcssserver, and rcssmonitor packages which are available at http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=24184. The versions used for this tutorial are 12.1.1, 12.1.3, and 12.1.0 respectively. Once downloaded, extract all three to a convenient location.\n\nAs much as I dislike working from the command prompt, we’re going to be using it pretty heavily during the install since we will be working with superuser priveleges. Open a terminal and navigate to your rcssbase directory. Once there, execute the configure script using sudo.\ncd RCSS/rcssbase-12.1.1/ sudo ./configure [enter sudo password]\n\nWhoops, I don’t have a C++ compiler yet. Using the Applications panel, open “System” -&gt; “Synaptic Package Manager”. Use the search tool to find the g++ Ubuntu package, mark it for install, and install it.\n\nSo lets try that again\nsudo ./configure [enter sudo password]\n\nWell, we made it farther. Turns out we need the Boost C++ libraries to compile RCSS. On top of this, the Ubuntu Boost package you can find in the Synaptic Package Manager doesn’t install all the Boost libraries you need. After banging my head on this for about an hour, I found some advice online and installed the additional Boost libraries at the command prompt. Once they are succesfully installed we can hopefully make it through configure.\nsudo apt-get install libboost-* sudo ./configure [enter sudo password]\n\n\nThe next step is to compile the rcssbase package.\nsudo make [enter sudo password]\n\n\nFinally, we install the package\nsudo make install [enter sudo password]\n\nI’ve added the screenshots for these steps to illustrate the final output of each of these steps, since it’s not too intuitive if you’ve succeeded or not. As a rule of thumb, compiling tends to fail in a big way. If you make it to gentle “Leaving directory” statements without rows and rows of errors, your likely ok. If you’re unsure, you can always read the output.\n\nThere’s one last thing we have to do before moving on. If you read through the output of the “make install” step, you will have noticed it complaining about libraries having been installed. To make these libraries accessible to other programs, we have two options. We can either list them in /etc/ld.so.conf, or we can create a file for listing RoboCup libraries inside the /etc/ld.so.conf.d directory. We’re going to go with that one since it keeps us out of an important system file.\ncd /etc/ld.so.conf.d sudo pico robocup.conf\n\nIn the file, we add two lines. One is to label the contents for our sake, and the other is to point to the directory make install was whining about.\n# RoboCup Soccer Simulator Libraries /usr/local/lib\n\nAfter saving our new file in Pico, we sudo run ldconfig to update our dynamic loader cache.\nStep 3 – Installing RCSS Server\nNow we walk through the same series of steps inside the rcssserver directory.\nsudo ./configure\nsudo make\nsudo make install\n\nI lucked out and didn’t have to add any more packages to compile and install, but if you hit a snag, just make sure to read the messages. Once you have successfully installed rcssserver, we need to add another line to our robocup.conf file\n# RoboCup Soccer Simulator Libraries\n/usr/local/lib\n/usr/local/lib/rcssserver/modules\n/\n\nAgain, sudo run ldconfig to update the dynamic loader cache.\n\nUnfortunately, we’re going to need more libraries before we can install the monitor package. We can use the Synaptic Package Manager to install the libxpm development packages.\n\nNow ./configure, make, make install that sucker. During the install, make threw-up many warnings. But so far I have ignored them and have not yet received punishment.\nStep 5 – Run, Hopefully\n\nWait.  I wasn't going to say anything when you skipped Step 2, but what happended to 4?\n\nOpen up two fresh terminals. In the first, type rcss followed by the tab key twice. If everything’s gone well, you should see a list of RCSS related programs we now have. Start the RCSS server running by entering “rcssserver”. There is no need to run the server with superuser privelages.\nIn your other terminal, start the RCSS monitor by entering rcssmonitor. Your first terminal should report a new monitor has connected. You can select “connect” in the rcssmonitor GUI and then “kick off” to see what happens if you had two teams of rocks make it to the World Cup. Connecting clients (soccer players) is for another tutorial.\n\nReferences\nHelp installing robocup server – http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=721261\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/installing-robocup-soccer-simulator-on-ubuntu/","title":"Installing RoboCup Soccer Simulator on Ubuntu"},"https://superlou.github.io/jumper-t8sg-v2-0-plus-review/":{"body":"The Jumper T8SG V2.0 Plus is a multi-protocol remotes with hall-effect gimbals commonly available near the $100 (USD) price point. It supports the Bayang protocol without any additional modules, which is perfect for the E011C I’ve been flying. At this price, it is a very interesting option for those just getting into flying but tired of toy remotes.\n\nI ordered the Jumper T8SG V2.0 Plus from Banggood for $108.11, including shipping insurance, and received it in under two weeks. I ordered the Mode 2 (left-hand throttle) variant in yellow. There is also a “carbon fiber” finished V2.0 Plus for a little bit more. Be careful that you are looking at the proper version, as there are non-V2.0, non-Plus, and “Lite” model also floating around.\nIf you are looking at a next step remote control, I didn’t see much below the $100 threshold that had great reviews. Around $40, Jumper makes a T8SG Lite, but it is much more bare bones. It has a toy gimbals, LCD instead of OLED display, fewer switches, no DIY box, smaller antenna, and a much more limited number of protocols. The FlySky FS-i6 (a.k.a Eachine i6, Turnigy TGY-i6) is also at a similar price as the Lite but has much more restricted radios, and I don’t know what my next drone might be.\nI’ve put together a 2-minute unboxing and pairing video demonstrating how easy it is to get flying with this remote and the budget drone I built earlier.\nWhat's Inside\n\nI received the remote in just under two weeks, and I was a little nervous that the minimalist packaging didn’t identify the specific T8SG model. However, a barcoded sticker on the side did identify the exact model, and the contained remote was marked with the proper silkscreens.\nA very basic quick start guide is included. The most useful information there is two links:\n\nhttp://www.jumper.xyz for a software configuration guide\nhttps://www.deviationtx.com for details on the supported protocols.\n\nThe remote itself is shipped inside a snug “carbon fiber” carrying case.\n\nThe included carrying case has a feel between nylon and styrofoam. While a bit flexible, it is stiff enough to protect the remote against light pressures, like when pressed in a backpack against other gear.\n\nSome accessories are packed in with the remote:\n\nJumper branded neck strap\nUSB Type A to mini USB cable\nAlternate battery pack for running on 3.7 V batteries (18650 batteries)\nPlastic centering lever and spring to optionally configure the throttle for self-centering\n\nFrom what I’ve read, the alternate battery pack and centering parts might be recent additions to the packaging of the yellow V2 Plus. The carbon fiber variant lists these items as part of the product. The remote itself was packed with foam spacers and wrapping, as well as protective film over the display.\nFirst Impressions\nI find holding the remote with a pinching or thumb grip very comfortable, and it is less bulky than older RC gear that I have used. I don’t have large hands, and be aware that it is smaller than some of its peers, like the Taranis Q X7. The Jumper also does not have rubber grips on the back that I’ve seen on pictures of the Taranis.\n\nAfter installing 4 AA batteries, the remote powers up with a very readable OLED display. The yellow-on-black contrast has been night and day compared to LCD display remotes I’ve used. Because I mostly use the remote indoors, I haven’t tried it under peak daylight conditions. It has been easily readable, though, when I flew outside.\n\nThere are a few rattles on this budget remote. The navigation buttons can wiggle in the chassis, though only if you’re looking for problems. The “DIY Box” on the back of the remote seats loosely, but a thin piece of self-stick weather stripping fixes the knocking sound it makes.\n\nThe switches and buttons actuate crisply, and the gimbals feel very smooth. The throttle travel slides a little more loosely than other remotes, but not so loose as to be an issue.\n\nOn the bottom left of the remote, the “enter” button is above the “back” button, and significantly smaller, which took some getting used to. The navigation menus are easy to decipher.\nPairing\nThe remote integrates four RF modules: CC2500, CYRF6936, A7105, NRF2401. The loaded build of Deviation firmware (t8sg_v2_plus-v5.0.0-e801244) supports an impressive number of protocols: AFHDS-2A, ASSAN, Bayang, BlueFly, Bugs3, Bugs3Mini, CFlie, CG023, Corona, CRSF, CX10, DEVO, DM002, DSM2, DSMX, E012, E015, ESky, ESky150, Flysky, FQ777, Frsky, Frsky-V8, FrskyX, FY326, GW008, H377, H8-3D, HiSky, Hitec, HM830, HonTai, Hubsan4, iNAV, J6PRO, Joysway, KN, MJXq, MT99XX, PPM, Q303, S-FHSS, SBUS, Skyartec, SLT, SymaX, USBHID, V202, WFLY, WK2401, WK2601, WK2801, and YD717.\nPairing with my modified E011C was painless.\n\nEnter the “Model menu”\nEnter “Model setup”\nSelect a new “file”\nChange the model name to “E011C,” or whatever you prefer\nChange the model type to “Multi”\nSelect “Bayang” from the protocol list\nClick “Re-Init” once the drone is powered up.\n\nThe remote also attempts on power-up to bind with the last model selected, which is very convenient since I only have one quadcopter right now.\nConclusions\nFlying with the T8SG V2 Plus instead of the toy controller that comes with the E011C was a bigger difference than I expected. I have much better control authority, especially in the vertical axis. I’m by no means a good pilot, but some of the maneuvers I’ve seen online feel achievable with practice, rather than magic. I also can go back to a “pinch” grip which is what I’m used to from other RC aircraft.\nSince the remote is running Deviation firmware, there is a full package of custom mixing settings that I have yet to go through. This allows an incredible amount of configuration, even without using the USB connection. I set a flight timer based on the position of toggle switch G, and positioned it on the screen, while decluttering some items from the screen I didn’t need.\nIn the end, the T8SG V2 Plus is about future proofing my remote without breaking the bank. A full-sized remote is like learning to fly the quadcopter all over again, but in a good way.\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/jumper-t8sg-v2-0-plus-review/","title":"Jumper T8SG V2.0 Plus Review"},"https://superlou.github.io/kodi-infrared-remote-and-cinnamon-linux-17-1/":{"body":"Back in 2013, I programmed an inexpensive media remote to control XBMC on Ubuntu with the help of a cheap infrared PC remote control.  Since then, I’ve messed up that Ubuntu install pretty well, so updating seemed like a good idea.\n\nI installed Linux Mint 17.1 and Kodi, the latest incarnation of XBMC.  Unfortunately, some of the media keys on the remote did not work, e.g. play.  Whenever I pressed them, I received a do-not-enter circle-cross symbol whether or not Kodi was running.

My home theater PC (picked up by a friend when Borders went out of business) did not have a built in infrared receiver, so the objective was to find a receiver compatible with the universal remote that would be nicely detected by Ubuntu.\n\nThe uncreatively named Wireless USB PC Remote Control Mouse for PC was cheap enough that I wouldn’t  be too unhappy if I couldn’t get it to work in Ubuntu. With the receiver plugged into the PC, lsusb indicates that it is a “Chaplet Systems, Inc. infrared dongle for remote.”  It even has a boot interface subclass 1, which means you might be able to use it like a keyboard from inside the BIOS.  Playing around with the remote, you can use it almost like a full keyboard and mouse, if you are patient enough to type via cellphone-multi-tap-esque entry.\nAssigning Functions\nThe media control keys seemed to work automatically with XBMC, and the universal remote had no difficulty learning them.\nThe action of the 5×3 grid of keys is handled on the receiver side.  Pressing the up-arrow/2abc key always sends the same IR signal, but depending on the mode of the current mod of the receiver (toggled by the Numlock key), determines the command seen by the computer.  This means that you need to pick which mode you will use with XBMC, as there’s no great way to handle mode switching on the universal remote.  I opted to set the receiver in “white silkscreen mode.”  This gives you access to the arrow keys, enter key, tab, backspace, and escape, which already have context in XBMC.  The function assignments I came up with are in the following table:\n\nNote: looks like an upgrade lost my table. :(\n\n[table id=1 /]\nI’m a big fan of using the default controls whenever possible, but I ran out of white silkscreen commands on the PC Remote. I taught the E-mail button of the PC Remote to the Menu key of the universal remote.  Then, I mapped the launch_mail “key” in XBMC by creating a keymap file in the XBMC configuration directory.  On a standard Ubuntu/Mint install, it is ~/.xbmc/userdata/keymaps/, so I created a new file called pc-remote.xml in that directory with the following contents:\n&lt;keymap&gt;\n  &lt;global&gt;\n    &lt;keyboard&gt;\n      &lt;launch_mail&gt;ContextMenu&lt;/launch_mail&gt;\n    &lt;/keymap&gt;\n  &lt;/global&gt;\n&lt;/keyboard&gt;\n\nThe full list of keys available for XBMC mapping is available on the XBMC wiki, including the names of media remote keys like launch_mail.\nRCRP05BR Key Learning Procedure\nFor convenience, here’s the procedure for learning a key on the universal remote:\n\nPress and hold SETUP until the last-selected mode key blinks twice, then press 9 7 5.\nPress a mode key once (TV, DVR, CBL, DVD, AUD) to assign a mode for learning.\nPress the desired key on the RCRP05B once to put the remote in listening mode for the pressed key.\nPoint the teaching remote at the learning remote about 2″ apart.\nPress (hold if necessary) the button on the teaching remote to be taught.\nRepeat steps 2 through 5 for each key you want to learn.

The remaining cards in the deck are placed face down in the center of each players’ fields. As cards are drawn from the deck, they may be discarded right next to it. Any number of people may play, just adapt the field to suit the number of players.\n\nOrder of play\nIn our example game with four players, the game progresses in sets. The order of each player in each set is determined by drawing from the deck. The player with the highest draw moves first, followed by the second highest draw, with play continuing in the same direction until everyone has made his or her moves for the set. After all players have gone, everyone draws again and the process continues. When only two players remain, there is a final draw by each player, and the highest drawer goes first and the two alternate until the end of the game. There is no longer any more drawing to determine order.\nThe player’s turn\nA player’s turn is split into three phases: Summon/Swap, Attack, and Movement (conveniently remembered through the acronym SAM). They must be taken in this order. All phases are optional but must be taken in the prescribed order. The only variation in the three phases is with the very first turn of the entire game, which does not have an attack phase. Let’s break down the three phases to see what they do:\n1. Summon/Swap\nAssume we are starting with six face down cards in our field in front of us. At the beginning of every turn each player is given 5 summon points to use to flip up cards. These are NOT accumulative between turns. This means a player can flip up a 2 through a 5 on any given turn, any card with a summon cost less than or equal to 5. To summons cards with a higher summon cost, already face up cards may be flipped down to add their face value to the 5 summon points of their turn. The face value of a card is the same as the number printed on them. Face cards run 11 through 14, Jack through Ace relatively. A card may only be flipped up once and down once in a turn, not necessarily in that order. As many cards as the player desires (within his own field) can be manipulated to draw on enough summon points. Extra summon points are eliminated at the end of the summon/swap phase of the player’s turn. If a player chooses to swap, the may put ONE face-down card face-up in the discard pile and replace that same position with a face-down card drawn from the deck. A player may choose to EITHER summon or swap in this phase of play.\n2. Attack\nEach player may attack once per turn using the following process. If the player decides to attack during his turn, he first declares which card he is attacking with. The player then draws a card from the deck and immediately discards it. It’s value determines the amount of attack points available this turn to the player. If it is higher or equal to the attack cost, usually a card’s face value, of the card the player wants to attack with, the player may now choose which card of an opponent he desires to attack. If it is lower, the player may flip down face-up cards on the field and add their value to the drawn card to gain enough attack points to be equal or greater than the attack cost they must pay. Most cards may only attack from the front of their field to the front of another’s field. A player may attack both face up and face down cards. We can now refer to cards as attacking and defending. The attacking card is always under the control of the player whose turn it is while the defending card can be controlled by any other player in the game. If a higher real value attacking card attacks a defending face-up card, the defender is sent to the discard pile and the space on the opponent’s field is now empty. If a lower real value attacking card attacks a defending face-up card, the attacker is flipped down and nothing happens to the defender. If a higher real value attacking card attacks a defending face-down card, the defender is forcibly flipped up and sent to the discard. If a lower real value attacking card attacks a defending face-down card, the defender is forcibly flipped up and the attacker is flipped down. When cards are forcibly flipped up, their owner is not required to pay anything or have any number of points or requirements. If the real value of two cards is the same, players may use a physical challenge as determined by the other players. These could include rock/paper/scissors, evens/odds, coin flip, triathlon, etc.. The winner’s card succeeds in either attacking or defending.\n3. Movement\nThe last phase of the player’s turn allows him or her the option of either swapping the positions of two face-down cards, or moving one face-down card to an open position. Face-up cards may NOT be moved.\nEach player must follow the above order of phases although any or all of the phases are optional. A player may not go more than three turns without performing a Summon/Swap or Attack.\nWhen all of a player’s back row or front row are eliminated from a row, all positions are treated as a front row for that player. This player may only regain the ability to use two rows if he or she gains four cards by having an opponent forcibly flip up a heart.\nIf the deck runs out, reshuffle the discard pile and place it upside down as a new deck.\nCard Special Modifiers\nThese apply to cards in various situations, from attacking/defending to determining then necessary attack points to function\n\nSuit Modifiers (apply to cards of a suit):\nClubs – has a summon cost 2- face value, has an attack cost 2+ face value\nHearts – if forcibly flipped up and destroyed a new card is drawn and replaces the card at the position it was destroyed, if forcibly flipped up and not destroyed, a new card is drawn and placed in an open position of the heart’s owner\nSpades – must attack over a row, may not attack from adjacent rows (ex: may attack an opponents back field from their owners front field or an opponents front field from their owner’s back row)\nDiamonds – have a real value 2+ their face value when defending and have a real value 2- their face value when attacking\nFace Modifiers (apply to face cards)\nIn a conflict between two face cards, the card with the higher real value has its real value decreased by 2. If both cards are equal real value, nothing happens. (ex: Jh attacking Qc, Jack destroys queen because the Jack has a real value of 11, while Queen’s value in this case become 10, two less than its initial 12)\nNumber modifiers (apply to specific face valued cards)\nFace value 2 – if already face up, the card may be used at the beginning of an attack phase or any time when defending time to boost the real value of another card by 2. If used with an attacking card that fails to destroy the targeted card, it is flipped down with the attacking card. If used with a defending card that is destroyed, it is not destroyed but is flipped down.\n\nTerms\nFace value – the number printed on a card or what would be assigned to it if numbering continued (7h = 7, 9d = 0, Jc = 11, Qd = 12, Kh = 13, Ad = 14)\nReal value – value of a card after its special modifiers are applied to its face value\nSummon cost – the amount of summon points required to flip up a card, usually a card’s face value\nAttack cost – the amount of attack points required to start an attack\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/oppugn/","title":"Oppugn"},"https://superlou.github.io/pages/":{"body":"","id":"https://superlou.github.io/pages/","title":""},"https://superlou.github.io/replacing-the-a-c-blower-resistor-on-a-2009-ford-escape/":{"body":"The A/C system of the Ford Escape has a resistive sensing element used regulate the blower motor.  If you find that the A/C blows air on some fan speeds but not others, it is likely that the blower motor resistor has burned out or otherwise failed.  On my 2009 Escape, the blower motor would run in positions 3 and 4, but not 1 or 2.  Based on other reports online, failing for the low speed settings seems to be the most common symptom.\n\nReplacing the resistor on the 2009 is cheap and simple, but since I could only find photos for the 2008 Escape, I took some pictures while my dad and I replaced the part.  I replaced the defective resistor with a CARQUEST RU1133 from Advanced Auto Parts though it is available from multiple distributors.  My Escape does not have automatic temperature control, as the temperature is set using a cold/warm knob and not via a digital temperature set in degrees.  You may need a different part if you have automatic temperature control.\nProcedure\nOpen the glovebox and empty it out.

I found it was easier to leave the harness on until after removing the screws since it kept the wires out of the way.\nThe keying on the original resistor (left) and new resistor (right) did not match, so I had to drill out two holes along the top.  Make sure to completely open the key holes so that it clears the alignment keys during installation.  I’m hoping this is so that the same part can be used on slightly different models, and not that I have the wrong part.\n\nRe-install the resistor into the slot.  When fastening with the screws be careful not to cross-thread the soft plastic or over tighten.  When trying to locate the screws by feel, they will go in the front-left and back-right holes looking from the passenger seat towards the resistor.\nReconnect the harness.\nTest the A/C system for each blower position to verify that the replacement is working.\nSet the glovebox back behind the stops and remove the dog from the passenger seat.\n\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/replacing-the-a-c-blower-resistor-on-a-2009-ford-escape/","title":"Replacing the A/C Blower Resistor on a 2009 Ford Escape"},"https://superlou.github.io/retraction-calibration/":{"body":"I bought an AliExpress Kossel Mini kit that is usually listed as an \"FLSUN.\"  It's been a great learning experience.  The latest challenge has been tuning the retraction settings to minimize the amount of stringy material carried by the nozzle as it moves between positions.  Note that this printer uses a Bowden extruder.  The values that worked for me should not be used for a direct feed extruder.\n\nThe printer has the following configuration:\n\nFirmware - Marlin 1.1.0-RC6\nHost Software - Repetier Host 1.6.2\nSlicer - Curaengine\nMaterial - Hatchbox 1.75 mm PLA, white\nTemperature - 200°C, this might have been a little hot given the glossiness of the prints\n\nThere are primarily two settings that affect retraction:\n\nDistance - how far the filament is pulled back into the extrusion head\nSpeed - how fast the filament is pulled back into the extrusion head\n\nI first disabled all retraction by setting both distance and speed to 0.  Using vector's retract/ooze test model from Thingiverse, I printed the base case (twice):\n\nYou can see that the stringing is severe between the towers.  I then printed an array of tests, increasing the retraction distance and speed:\n\nFrom these trials, I've been using 6mm and 80 mm/s, since it seems to be the point where there is minimal further reduction in stringing.  The printer seems to be significantly more sensitive to changes in retraction distance than retraction speed.  These values worked for me using a Bowden extruder, which typically requires a longer retraction distance compared to a direct feed extruder.  When calibrating your own printer, remember to start small and only change one variable at a time, increasing the retraction length by small amounts.  If I did this again, I'd probably increase by 1 mm per step rather than 2 to find the smallest retraction distance that minimizes stringing.\nHowever, I still have some issues with warts as the print head moves, though I don't know if those can be fixed through improved retraction settings.  You can see the warts between the tail and the back of the body.\n\nBased on some feedback online, I ran a series of temperature tests using a more complicated model, hoping that the fine features would provide more insight.  Each print was run with 6 mm, 80 mm/s retraction:\n\nThe results were less dramatic than I expected, and the small changes are hard to see from the pictures.  There was no sign of delamination or poor adhesion down to 185°C.  There was a small improvement in the \"fingers\" along the near-left side of the print as the temperature was decreased.  Somewhat counterintuitively, stringing seemed to become worse as the temperature decreased.  At the lowest temperature, there were significantly more surface imperfections compared to 190°C, so that's what I've decided to use for this filament.\nDoes anyone have any tips on what to try next?\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/retraction-calibration/","title":"3D Printer Retraction Calibration"},"https://superlou.github.io/setting-up-libgdx-on-ubuntu-13-04/":{"body":"I recently received an Ouya and want to try coding a game for it. While the favorite child for Ouya developments seems to be Unity3D, the Unity IDE cannot be run on Linux.  While there are a huge set of frameworks and game engines for developing on Android, I didn’t want to have to do game testing entirely via an Android Virtual Device or by loading onto a phone.  Fortunately, libGDX provides a cross platform framework that should let me do most of the testing in on my PC.\nSetup\nCreate a libGDX Project in Android Developer Tools.\nThe libGDX wiki has a list of prerequisites but instead of using standalone Eclipse and installing the Android SDK, we’re going to use the Android Developer Tools Bundle which contains an IDE (based on Eclipse) with the Android SDK already bundled and configured.  When dealing with many Eclipse plugins and environments targeting very specific tool-chains, I find that the seperate Eclipse instances make configuration easier to debug.  Get the ADT Bundle from downloads.  I’m using the 64-bit bundle with the build suffix 20130522.  Unzip it into a folder like ~/ouya.\nStart ADT at ~/ouya/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20130522/eclipse/eclipse, and install the Google Web Toolkit Plugin into ADT.  You will need to follow the instructions from https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/install-eclipse-4.2 to get the version compatible with Eclipse 3.8 which is what ADT is currently built on.  If you are using a later version of ADT, you may need to point at a different installation site.\n\nClick next, agree to the licenses, and install.\nDownload the libGDX SDK from the stable releases.  I am using version 0.9.8.  I unzipped it into ~/ouya.  Set the executable bit on gdx-setup-ui.jar, and run it using a JDK runtime.  The GUI should start.\n\nCreate a project and configure it as befits your project.  Mine is about boats.\n\nIf the LibGDX library listed under required libraries is red, download it by clicking on the “download latest stable version” icon.  Once you get the pleasant “Your Configuration is valid” notification, click on “Open the generation screen.”  Click “Launch!” to generate your projects.\n\nBack in ADT, we can import our new projects.  In the ADT menu bar, choose File &gt; Import… and from the General folder, select “Existing Projects into Workspace.”  Press next, and set the root directory to the location of your libGDX projects.\n\nAfter the import, I had a build error on the boats-android project.  To resolve it, edit the project’s properties and select an Android Build Target.\n\nI also had a build error on the boats-html project which was fixed by selecting the GWT SDK to be added to the project’s build path.\n\nRun the Project\nAndroid\nSelect the android project, and chose run from the menu.  If you receive a “No active compatible AVD’s or devices found…” error, edit the project’s run configurations and select an Android Virtual Device.\n\nIf you don’t  have an AVD, create one.  Click run, and wait (possibly for a few minutes) for the AVD to start.  If successful, you should see the application start up.\n\nI was also able to run the application on my phone, though I haven’t figured out how to take a picture of my phone with my phone.\nDesktop\nSelect the desktop project and run as a Java Application.\n\nHTML5\nWhen you run the html project, a development server will start with a link to open the game in the browser.  Firefox will alert that “Development Mode requires the Google Web Toolkit Developer Plugin.”  Install the plugin, and after Firefox restarts, you should see the default game.\n\nConclusion\nIt sure looks like libGDX is running cross-platform, as promised.  I’m going to have to learn some Android programming to see if I can find any gotchas, but so far it looks good.  The next step is to try loading the game onto my Ouya.  The whole configuration went remarkably smoothly, so let me know if you encounter any obstacles.\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/setting-up-libgdx-on-ubuntu-13-04/","title":"Setting up libGDX on Ubuntu 13.04"},"https://superlou.github.io/simple-stepper-motor-control-with-raspberry-pi/":{"body":"Stepper motors are a type of brushless DC motor that can be controlled so that they advance a fixed step size.  Additionally, they provide a strong holding torque.  This can make them useful in applications where you want to rotate the motor precisely without employing encoders.  When prototyping, I like to use development boards that can be transferred to a custom PCB easily.  This gives me a clear path if I want to move the design from the Protoboard to something more polished.\n\nHere’s the parts list:\n\nPololu DRV8825 carrier\n57oz-in 1Nm NEMA 17 Stepper Motor 1.3A 40mm for CNC router or mill\n100 Pcs 25V 100uF 105C Radial Lead Electrolytic Capacitors\nRaspberry Pi Model A (256MB) – I had a Model A laying around, but you should be able to use the Model B with a little modification\nAdafruit Pi Cobbler Breakout Kit for Raspberry Pi – Assembled! – If you are using the Model B, you may want the breakout for the full model B GPIO header\nHiMart New DC 12V 3A Switching Power Supply Adapter For 110V- 240V AC 50/60Hz 2.1mm With HiMart Robbin\n\nWait.  Didn’t you say that you wanted a clear path to an integrated PCB design?  Why use the Pi then?  You’ll be hard-pressed to design that SoC into your own design, or at the least, make a full Linux compatible single board PC.  Because I’m a hypocrite.  Maybe we’ll connect it to a joystick down the road, and this will make life easier.\nThe Circuit\nThe minimum number of connections are used for this proof-of-concept.  I’m using the pins labeled GPIO 7 and GPIO 8 in the Raspberry Pi documentation to control the DRV8825’s STEP and DIR inputs, respectively.\n\nMake sure to turn the DRV8825 carrier board’s potentiometer fully counter-clockwise.  This will severely limit the coil current, but prevent burn-out before we are ready to set this properly.\nThe Software\nThere are a few options for controlling the Pi’s GPIO pins.  I’m going to avoid the high-level libraries to get high-speed control of the IO pins. Joonas Pihlajamaa provides a through benchmark of the various options, showing that C is needed to get high-speed control of the GPIO.  We could probably write a Python wrapper around some C code to get achieve high speed control, but for simplicity, lets use the minimum needed to verify that our circuit is working.  The 3 files main.c, gpio.c, and gpio.h are all that is needed to get the motor turning.  It’s nearly identical to the RPi low-level peripheral example, though I wrapped some of the operations for convenience.\nThe project’s code is available on Github.\nThe Test\nTurn the potentiometer clockwise 20 degrees or so. With the Raspberry Pi header or 12 V supply disconnected, you should be able to rotate the stepper motor shaft by hand. With both connected, the DRV8825 will be enabled and the stepper will hold. The torque required to rotate the motor should feel much higher and you can hear a high pitched whine from motor, though the later varies with hold torque, age, and hearing damage. Follow Pololu’s procedure to adjust the power limiting via the potentiometer.\nThe test program must be executed with “sudo” or as root because it accesses /dev/mem. If everything works out, the motor should spin smoothly when you run the program.\n\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/simple-stepper-motor-control-with-raspberry-pi/","title":"Simple Stepper Motor Control with Raspberry Pi"},"https://superlou.github.io/smoothing-rates-of-change/":{"body":"This is probably something that would have been obvious to everyone else, but stumped me for a bit when I came across it the other day.  I was looking at the rate of change of a sequence, and my smoothing algorithm wasn’t doing any better than just subtracting two points in the sequence farther apart.  In fact, the results were identical.  This won’t be particularly rigorous, but I believe the concept is valid.\nDifference Between Points in a Sequence\nWe are looking at a set of samples $d[n]$, sampled at some set frequency.  Let’s create a new series which is the difference (delta) between every two consecutive points:\n$$\\Delta d[n] = d[n] - d[n-1]$$\n$\\Delta d[n]$ is the rate of change from one point to another, or can be thought of as the slope between the points.  Let’s generalize this for the case where we take the difference not between consecutive points, but between points spaced $s$ apart:\n$$\\Delta_s d[n] = \\frac{1}{s} \\left( d[n] - d[n-s] \\right)$$\nThe $\\frac{1}{s}$ is because, if you think in terms of slope, the spacing between your points has widened.  I’ll refer to this operation as taking the “spaced delta” of the sequence.  There’s probably a proper word for this, and I’m hoping someone will comment with it.\nThe Moving Average\nIn my application, the sequence $d[n]$ was the sampled positions of a device, and since I was more concerned with how fast it was moving, I was looking at $\\Delta_1 d[n]$, the rate of change.  Since this will be noisy when using real-world data, it needs to be smoothed.  An easy goto in the digital signal processing toolbox is the moving average.  You just average the past $w$ samples.  It’s relatively cheap so long as $w$ isn’t too large, and it is actually ideal for removing random noise while preserving step response.  Let’s define a moving average of our original sequence $d[n]$ as:\n$$M_w d[n] = \\frac{1}{w} \\left( d[n] + d[n-1] + d[n-2] + \\ldots + d[n-w] \\right)$$\nSmoothing the Rate of Change\nI want to smooth out our rate-of-change sequence, which looks like:\n$$\\Delta_1 d[n] = \\left[ \\ldots, d[n+2]-d[n+1], d[n+1]-d[n], d[n]-d[n-1], d[n-1]-d[n-2], d[n-2]-d[n-3], \\ldots  \\right]$$\nIf we plug these points into $M_w d[n]$ to average out the most recent $w$ points, we have:\n$$M_w \\left( \\Delta_1 d[n] \\right) = \\frac{1}{w} \\left( (d[n]-d[n-1]) + (d[n-1]-d[n-2]) + (d[n-2]-d[n-3]) + \\ldots + (d[n-w+1] – d[n-w]) \\right)$$\nThe neat thing is that all of the inner terms cancels out, leaving:\n$$M_w \\left( \\Delta_1 d[n] \\right) = \\frac{1}{w} \\left( d[n] - d[n-w] \\right)$$\nThis is identical to the spaced delta with a spacing equal to the length of the moving average:\n$$M_w \\left( \\Delta_1 d[n] \\right) = \\Delta_w d[n]$$\nWhy This is Important\nTrying to keep my terminology consistent, the special case of a spaced delta where the spacing is one is the rate of change of the system.  If you want to run a moving average on the rate of change of a sequence to smooth it, you can instead simply take the spaced delta of the original sequence with the spacing equal to what your moving average width would be.  This saves a large number of operations, and has less opportunity for errors to accumulate when you are working on systems with limited precision.\nTo note, I assumed that all of the operations needed to be causal, but I believe the result holds true without this so long as you are consistent.\n","id":"https://superlou.github.io/smoothing-rates-of-change/","title":"Smoothing Rates of Change"},"https://superlou.github.io/vfr-flight-minimums/":{"body":"While studying for the Private Pilot Knowledge (Written) Test, I had a hard time memorizing the rules governing the minimum requirements for VFR in the difference airspaces.

I still prefer Drupal for sites that justify a CMS, but for a blog, why not use blogging software.  My biggest complaint with wordpress (other than The Loop) is how obviously WordPress most of the themes look.  I’m under no impressions that I can revolutionize WordPress aesthetics, but I figure I can make an obviously derivative theme on my own.\nAfter a quick search, it seems like the big names in starter themes are Underscores and Bones.  I chose to go forward with Bones because it provides a little more default styling than Underscores.  Rather than styling with CSS, Underscores heavily recommends that you compile your stylesheets from LESS or SASS.  Since I have more familiarity with SASS, I’m going to go down that road.  However, either language should be compiled server side.  This blog is a low traffic learning experience, so I’m going to do all of my theme editing live (or on a testing subdomain) and not hosted locally.  It’s not great practice.\nAnyway, lets work with SASS on Bluehost.  Our first step is to get SSH access to the Bluehost server.  You can request SSH access from the Bluehost cPanel. Once we have access to our account over SSH, we’ll need to install some gems.  Fortunately, Bluehost has the RubyGem package manager installed.\ngem install sass\ngem install –version ‘~&gt; 0.9′ rb-inotify # provides better performance when polling the filesystem for changed files\n\nNow we watch the Bones library/scss folder for changes and automatically compile a new stylesheet:\ncd\n/wp-content/themes/\nsass –watch library/scss:library/css\n\nIf we’re successful, we can edit _base.scss, change the body background, and watch sass recompile.
